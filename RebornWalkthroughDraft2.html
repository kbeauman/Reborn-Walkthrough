<p>=====================</p>
<p>Before you begin the game, I highly advise reading the Hints section of the README_REBORN_253_ENG.txt file in the Reborn Team folder. My Windows 7 installation put the folder on my desktop. Here are a few hints of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>This game crashes a lot! Save often, especially after you score an important find or complete a difficult task. Also, Saves, especially Quick Saves, seem to get corrupted after you load them several times. If you're having a hard time with something and find yourself reloading several times, I suggest making a backup Save, i.e., load the Save, then Save again under another name.</li>
<li>I play this at either Stalker or Veteran level. If you play at Novice, you may find it easier to kill some mutants, encounter fewer Undefeatable Zombies, and fewer enemies in general. However, you may also find some of the items mentioned in this walkthrough, such as PDAs, are missing. Example: When you first arrive at the Garbage and free the hostages from the Vehicle graveyard, you may not get a reward.</li>
<li>The dialogs are, at times, mind-numbingly long in comparison to the original game. To make matters worse, the writing style is either an abysmal attempt at vernacular or we’re suppose to think all these characters flunked the second grade. Many of these conversations seem to have no bearing on the game, serve to be misleading information, or distractions from the main objectives.</li>
<li>Most Zombies can be taken out with a single shot gun to the head (pump, not that semi-auto piece of junk). Just don’t let them get too close. When there is a group of them, an RPG works in most cases. The flamethrower works, too. But I like to save that for the spiders.</li>
<li>The best weapon I’ve found for taking out Controllers, Burers (a.k.a. lawn gnomes), and Undefeatable Zombies (usually wearing an Exoskeleton suit) is the Barrett M82A1 (.50 cal). Again, head shot = one shot. You can also do it with about five or six rounds from the Dragunov, or several rounds from a Vintar.</li>
<li>Mutant spiders can’t climb very high. My favorite tactic is to get up on a vehicle or boulder and give them each about five shot gun blasts, a couple of VOG-25 grenades, or a blast from the flamethrower.</li>
<li>Bloodsuckers cannot be killed while invisible with most weapons. However, they show themselves just before they strike. So, if you’re up for a game of chicken, load up the shot gun and stand your ground. You may also want to save before and after the encounter.</li>
<li>I've added links to various pages of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Clear_Sky" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Wiki: Clear Sky</a> to provide more information. I've written quite a bit on the stashes, locations, and helped on some other pages.</li>
<li>Check every corpse, you never know what you might find.</li>
<li>Possible bug with traders: If you attempt a big trade with one of the traders and get a message that they don't have enough money, try one or two items at a time.</li>
</ul>
<div>User note: I thought about putting "Back to the top" links in periodically because this walkthrough is so long. Instead, I'd like to offer this tip. You can do the same thing with most browsers by holding the Ctrl key down and clicking the top of the side scroll bar (just below the arrow).</div>
<h3>The Walkthrough</h3>
<p>==============</p>
<p>As you can tell by the empty entries in the preceding lists, this is a work in progress. If you have any suggestions, things that I've missed, or questions, please send me a note: kwag_myers@att.net.
<h3 id="zarton">Zarton</h3>
<p>The game starts with you spawning at sunset in the northwest corner of the Zarton map from Call of Pripyat (COP) and you instantly get a message to run. If you don’t, a mutant thorn bush makes you start the game all over. Sprint southeast toward the bridge, which is west the Burnt Farmstead, and then check the map when you get there. This is a good place to save, because if you get caught by a Psuedogiant you have to start all over again with a new game. Head southeast to the Skadovsk, which is marked on your map, and stay away from the Psuedogiants. They don't come after you unless you get too close.</p>
<p>Once at the Skadovsk you will notice that you can’t stand on the mess decking. This is important to know because it can work for you or against you, depending on where you are. This also is true for wire fences. Go inside, up the stairs and turn left to get the “swag”. You might as well put your weapons away because they are useless on this map.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the map, you may find a few corpses (with nothing on them) and the south end of the Preobrazhensky Bridge is surrounded by a teleport that takes you back to the complex on the north end of the bridge where there's spiders and Zombies. One video I watched shows an artifact at the south end of the bridge, but I haven't figured out how to get there without teleporting back to the north end. The player who made the video had an impressive inventory, so maybe we'll come back to this later?</p>
<p>The PDA shows only one transition point in the Testing Workshop of the Iron Forest (a.k.a. the Stingray 2 crash site), which is in the southwest corner of the map. The problem is, the place is infested with mutants. You don’t have enough ammo to kill them all, so a little game of Catch Me If You Can is your best option: </p>
<ul><li>One tactic, which seems easy if you do it right, is to enter the area from the east. Walk toward the mutants until you hear them react, then run back to an opening in the wall as far south (right) as you can. Then head south around the shipping crates and to the far southeast corner of where the buildings along the south side of the complex extend out to the east. Wait for the mutants to be sure they don't lose your trail (otherwise you have to start all over again). When the first mutant gets close, walk through the fence and wait for the rest of them to join up. Again, the Psuedogiants are the slowest and once the first one gets there, sprint east before it stomps. Go west until you can get between the buildings and then head north to the end of the wall that runs along the west side of the Iron Forest. Carefully maneuver around the wall and sprint to the Testing Workshop.</li>
<li>Another tactic is to show yourself to the mutants at the north end of the complex, then run northeast to the Oakpine anomaly. This tactic is much riskier because if you stop while the mutants are chasing you, you're dead. Climb up and wait for all the mutants to get there. You don't need to go to the top, but just so you're over the gully to cause the mutants to go below you. I like to use the southwest leg of the anomaly as it's the shortest distance and easy to walk up. Once the first Psuedogiant is almost below you, sprint back to the Testing Workshop. Don't wait too long because the Psuedogiants will stomp and you won't be able to sprint for a few seconds, which is all the spiders need to catch you.</li>
</ul>
<div>Note: This next part is complicated and you may be able to pause the game when you reach the bottom of the second set of stairs if you need to reference this section again.</div>
<p>As soon as you enter the door, turn left and go down the steps one level, then left through the doorway and follow the hall to the right. If you encounter a blind dog along the way, just keep running. If you're playing at the Master level, you may also have a black spider in your way. They usually take four to five shot gun blasts and you only have two in the chamber. You'll be dead before you can reload, so try to jump over it.</p>
<p>At the end of the hall, there's a quick right than left down two more sets of stairs at a right angle and continue down a longer hall (don't go all the way down the stairs, but just to the first doorway). At the end and to the left are four more sets of stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, go through the door on the right, and then left into the large room where the Psuedogiant was in Call Of Pripyat. Mounted to the wall on the left is a ladder you can climb to the top. Now you’re safe from the mutants and may want to quick save in case you fall transitioning to the cat walk. If you're bleeding and loosing health, take a vodka or two.</p>
<div>Condensed version: Left stairs, left door, right hall, right/left stairs, left stairs, right, left, ladder.</div>
<p>In Call Of Pripyat, there was an opening in the duct work in the southwest corner of the room opposite where you entered that led to the area where you found the papers for the Gauss rifle. This is where the transition point is located. Make your way over there using the overhead crane. In fact, you can stay on the cat walk of the crane to transition point without actually jumping down into the duct.</p>
<h3 id="yantar">Yantar</h3>
<div>At this point in the game, the map on your PDA has some added reference points. Some differ from the original Clear Sky and I will try to use this game's version to (hopefully) avoid confusion.</div>
<p>You transport to the Mobile Lab compound in Yantar and the screen displays a thought. This is your cue to make your way to the Clear Sky camp in the Swamp to get answers from Dr. Bashnya. There are two transition points to Agroprom, one to the south and another to the east (which is guarded by a group of Zombies). It doesn’t matter which one you take, but I recommend taking on the Zombies so you can start collecting weapons and ammo. Be aware that these guys are packin’ some heavy weaponry. But they're not too quick and you can run past them before they react. Then you'll have more cover, and if you're lucky, the zombie with the RPG will do your work for you. If not, you should have just enough shot gun ammo to take them out with head shots. Collect as much gear as you can, and notice that you can carry a whole lot more that your limit. At this point (without artifacts) you can carry 200 kilograms. Once you’re done with the Zombies, you may be tempted to go hunting Zombies for more loot. But there's plenty along the way, so I recommend you head for the transition point.</p>
<div>If you happen to score an RPG, be sure to save at least four rounds for later. There's a couple of helicopters coming up that you'll want to get rid of if you have the ammo.</div>
<h3 id="agroprom">Agroprom</h3>
<p>If you used the southeast transition point, there are two corpses on top of the hill in front of you (the Stone Ring) with more loot. Walk between or around the two trees, up the slope and climb on top of the rocks to avoid the mutants. Also, avoid contact with Duty even though they show as neutral on your PDA, as they turn on you without warning. There are some Zombies in the area if you want more swag (remember: head shots save ammo). Also, if you happen to gain stash coordinates, you can leave them for now and collecting them later in the game. Especially if the stash is near a Duty post. By the time you get to a trader, you'll have more than you can carry anyway.</p>
<p id="sheluden">From the Stone Ring, head southeast to the Barracades by a train car, which may also have a few armed Zombies around. In the tower is a dead Bandit named Sheluden with the first PDA. Sheluden's PDA has some valuable information on flash drives and another PDA in the Underground, which we will get to later. Many of these flash drives contain information about hidden transition points. Getting off the top of the ladder can be tricky. Look up and to the left usually works for some reason. Turn around and walk to the outside of the platform, then along the south to the corpse and check your health (you probably need a vodka soon). Loot the corpse, get down as quick as you can and take another vodka if you need to. Then head for the northeast transition point to teleport to the Garbage. If you encounter Zombies with no weapons, just sprint past them.</p>
<h3 id="garbage">Garbage</h3>
<div>If you free the hostages at the Vehicle graveyard, you get a stash as a reward, which contains a very handy Vepr shotgun.</div>
<p>Head for the transition point near the Receiving Outpost at the south end of the road, again avoiding any contact. As you approach you'll hear a fire fight, which usually ends with an RPG blast. A squad of Russian Special Forces (RSF) is attacking some Bandits. You can either wait for the attackers to finish up and head toward the Gravel Pit, or try to take them out with an RPG as they leave. Either way, there's probably more loot than you can carry at this point.</p>
<p>Be sure to save before you move on and check your PDA, because you never know who or what is going to be waiting for you when you spawn at the Far Outpost. I've been greeted by mutants and a squad of RSF. I was able to fight my way past the RSF, but the mutants forced me to go back through the Garbage, Dark Valley, and then to the Cordon.</p>
<h3 id="cordonNorth">Cordon North</h3>
<p>From the Far Outpost, you may encounter a Controller having lunch on a corpse near the Camp Under Rocks. If you are lucky enough to score a .50 cal, take the head shot. Or, a Dragunov does the job with five head shots. Otherwise, go east through the fence and keep your distance. As you head south toward the Northern Farmstead in the Cordon there are mutants, another Controller, and two Burers on the west side of the road near the Bivouac in the Meadow. This is a fight you don't need to start, so it's best to avoid them. You may notice two transition points to the west of Hideout Under Rocks. These are described <a href="#sultan">here</a>.</p>
<p id="fdswamp">More corpses near Camp in Spruce Forest guarded by unarmed Zombies. You should be able out maneuver them and save some ammo. Sheluden's PDA mentions a flash drive at the Quiet Hideout, which is east of the Old Farmstead. The corpse is guarded by some Psuedodogs and at least one of them is a cloner. It's best to take them out from a distance before they start cloning to save ammo. I should mention that clones can go through fences, too. The body of the RSF has a flamethrower and the Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Swamps. Get to the Northern Farmstead so you can trade in all your goodies and get your gear repaired. You can take on optional missions, but there's no flash drives or PDAs in it for you. And unless you are really hard up for cash, these are a waste of time.</p>
<p id="cordontp">From the Quiet Hideout, go west to the Bonfire in Forest, but not to the transition point. There's a helicopter that likes to shoot rockets at you when you're in the Village Center. From the Bonfire in Forest, go up the hill to the railroad tracks and follow them west until you can get a good shot with an RPG. If you're luck enough to hit it in the tail section, it will go down with one shot. Otherwise, you're going to need a second hit. Once that's out of the way, follow the western edge of the map heading south towards the transition point in the southwest part of the map. As you pass the Bonfire Under Tree, be sure to stay on the east side of the fence. There's a hidden teleport up on the hill that we don't want to use just yet.</p>
<p>Go straight to the transition point and do NOT stop at Sidorovich's. You may only get one chance to visit Sidorovich, and if you go in now, you will probably wish you hadn't later. Go outside the fence when you get close to the tunnel so the military doesn't start shooting. Go into the tunnel and teleport to the Swamp.</p>
<h3 id="swamp">Swamp</h3>
<p>You spawn on the east side of the Southern Farmstead, which has a few Lone Wolfs that you can either avoid or take out. Then head for the Clear Sky camp by following the fence that runs south of the Southern Farmstead. As you approach the gate, you’ll be stopped by a rather length dialog, at which time you can choose how you want to play the rest of the game. My choice for this walkthrough is to join Clear Sky. Here are the objectives:
<ul><li>Find the Art-hunter and buy artifacts.</li>
<li>Find the way to Limansk.</li>
<li>Find all three Artifacts Of Death.</li>
<li>Collect 12 PDAs.</li>
</ul></p>
<p id="facCom">I should also mention that I found playing the game with emissions on only slows the game down and offers no additional change your playing abilities, only to your patience. Also, Lebedev tells you about using Esc+F2, which brings up the Faction Commander control panel. This may be helpful when you're ordered to capture and hold a point on the map, but don't have any support from Clear Sky. You can use the Faction Commander to hire some help, or capture it on your own and hire a squad to hold (defend) the position.</p>
<div><b>Notes:</b> There are two teleports in Clear Sky's camp. One is behind the trader's counter and takes you near the Camp Amidst Some Rocks in the Dark Valley. You have to jump up on the counter, then crouch-walk to get to it. The other teleport is in the tree next to the technician's hut, and usually takes you to the top of the Flea Market. However, I have ended up southwest of the Pump Station once (I think it depends on where you are in the game as to the destination). To use it, go up the stairs of the hut, turn right and go up the ramp to the roof of the building east of the hut. Then, jump to the front part of the hut's roof and sprint-jump at the tree.</div>
<div id="fdswampabout">I wasn't able to find a transition point mentioned in the <a href="#fdswamp">flash drive</a>. I checked the graves next to the old church and the graves just north of there. I looked at several locations for a small grave yard, but the only one I found is east of the Clear Sky base. However, the grave yard next to the church is the landing spot for the secret transition point behind the Duty base in the Agroprom (maybe that's it?). <a href="#agropromtele">More information here</a>.</div>
<p>Don’t forget to cash in any weapons you collected from the Lone Wolfs and get your reward. Also, make sure your gear is in good shape. Novicov is the only technician that can install night vision on Clear Sky suits (if you happen to have one), so get it fitted before you leave the Swamp. Be sure to talk to Lotsman, the guide at the south end of the camp. He gives you some information on transition points (which I haven’t quite figured out how to use yet). He also agrees to meet you in Limansk, which is an important part of the game.</p>
<p>Once you’re ready to leave the camp, check your PDA for a red target west by northwest of the camp. This is Meatgrinder, and that’s your next objective. After talking with him, head for the watchtower on the west edge of the map, where in the original Clear Sky, you were sent on your first mission. The guy in the tower tells you to run for the tower and when you do, he climbs down and gets killed. Once you clear out the mutants, be sure to get his Monstrpress shot gun, which can be used as a secondary weapon. There's a Pseudogiant in the area which desided to wait for me at the base of the tower once. I was able to kill it with a single RPG round to the head.</p>
<div>There's another helicopter that flies along the northern and northwestern edge of the Swamp, and attacts places along the north, like the Village Ruins and Northern Farmstead. On a clear day, you can hit the helicopter with an RPG from the watchtower. If you're low on RPG rounds and happen to have a minigun, this helicopter stops and turns around northwest of Boulder Island where you can take it down with about 200-300 rounds.</div>
<p>You now have an Echo detector and can start collecting artifacts. From the tower, there's an artifact to the south, then head north to the area marked Detector "Veles" on your PDA map. There's two more artifacts along the way. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Anomalies_and_Artifacts_in_Clear_Sky_%28Maps%29"  target="_blank">Clear Sky Artifacts</a> for a map. Be sure to collect as many artifacts as you can and read the description of each one. Some artifacts can be used to create a Gravi anomaly (a.k.a. <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Springboard" target="_blank">Springboard</a>) and you should save them. To use an artifact, put it in the secondary weapon spot and hold the shoot key/button for a few seconds to deploy. You may want to practice a few times to get the timing down. The downside to using artifacts is when one of your allies gets killed by the anomaly, his friends turn on you. Usually, just those in his squad and the rest of the faction stays friendly.</p>
<p>Remember that Veles behind the mattress in the original Clear Sky? If not, there’s a cave between the box cars and bridge, and behind the mattress in the corner is a Veles detector. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Hidden_Veles_Detector" target="_blank">Hidden Veles Detector</a> if you need a walkthrough. And be sure to check the cave for an artifact before you leave. You may pick up a Gravi that's not on the aforementioned Clear Sky Artifacts map.</p>
<p>At this point, you can hang around the Swamp as long as you like, maybe take some jobs and build up your inventory of ammo and cash. You can buy stashes from the trader and barkeep, but none of them have flash drives or PDAs. I like to capture all the points on the map, then spawn a squad using the <a href="#facCom">Faction Commander</a> set at Expansion to hold the point. This reduces the number of messages you get when you leave the Swamp about Clear Sky objectives that you really don't need to be concerned with. Otherwise, the Lone Wolfs move right back in and you're constantly getting mission objectives for the Swamp throughout the rest of the game. Or, you can just head for the Northern Farmstead and ignore the messages.</p>
<p>Up in the northeast corner of the map, east of the Northern Farmstead, is a Person of Interest. This is Zarka, and she will ask you to escort her to her friends, which are northwest of the Encampment Under Embankment. Before you contact Zarka, you have to clear out the Northern Farmstead. When you do, be sure to watch your PDA for reinforcements coming in from the southwest. If you look out the western facing window of the house you can see the bridge they use to get to the farm.</p>
<p>Take Zarka to her friends (who may not actually be there, but it doesn't matter). Be sure to keep her on the minimap or she’ll go back to her starting point. She stops by the pond just west of the Northern Farmstead to check for anomalies, then goes west until the fence turns north toward the train wreck. She passes the train wreck on the north side and meets up with her buddies just a little further west. After the dialog, they head to Agroprom, but don’t bother trying to follow them.</p>
<p>When you're ready to move on, ask a guide to take you to the Village Center, or head for the transition point in the northeast corner of the map (where you met Zarka).</p>
<h3 id="cordonSouth">Cordon South</h3>
<p>If you used the transition point, you spawn in the Cordon just south of the Military Outpost. Walk on the east side of the fence until you get past the mine field. Go see Wolf in the Village Center and talk to him about helping a stalker (named Anelia) from the tunnel to the Dark Valley, which is marked Bonfire by Tunnel on your PDA map. Anelia is trapped by three or four Bloodsuckers running around the camp. This is not actually a job with the objective listed in your PDA or marked on the map. But it is necessary to gain one of the Artifacts of Death. But first you have to clear the way, or you'll have a tough time completing the mission. There's a Burer and some mutants at, or north of, the Camp Near Van just north of the Village Center. Then head for the Vehicle Station, where you have to take out the RSF there in order to clear the way for Anelia.</p>
<p>The easiest way I've found to clear out the Vehicle Station is to use the bus stop as cover and snipe as many as you can. If you're luck, a bunch of them will come out the front gate where you can take them out with an RPG. Sometimes one or two of them stay inside the buildings and you have to go in to finish clearing them out. Then head east to the Bonfire by Tunnel.</p>
<p>My tactic for dealing with these Bloodsuckers is to stand in the road just west of the rail fence. This seems to be their boundary for some reason and you can step forward a few steps to bait them to come at you. Remember to wait until they show themselves just before striking and take your shot. Oh, and you have to give Anelia a gun before she will leave. In one game, Anelia was actually west of the camp and safe from the Bloodsuckers. Still, I had to clear them out and wait for her to go sit in the shelter before getting her to leave. Like Zarka, you must keep Anelia on your minimap as you escort her to the Village Center, or you'll have to start the mission all over again.</p>
<div>Note: I noticed that when I tried to quick save and go back to that point, Anelia might return to the starting point. Regular saves seem to be safe.</div>
<p id="joker">When you get back to the camp, Anelia tells you all about looking for her father and how her boyfriend came to the Zone to make some money for their wedding, but became a zombie instead. Let her tell her story because you get coordinates for a stash when she's done. Then go get the stash and the nearby artifact. See the walkthrough for <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Reward_for_a_hero#Walkthrough" target="_blank">Reward for a Hero</a> if you need help getting the artifact. In the stash is the Joker of Horror flash drive that tells you to look up Korsakov, who is in the Agroprom.</p>
<p>Go back to the Village Center and find Anelia, who is hold up in the underground storm cellar. Offer to take her to her father and she leads the way, leaving the camp on the west end, over the hill to the Bonfire Under Tree, through the fence (I guess she can do the fence thing too) and up the hill toward the hidden transition point. Then she turns around and goes back past the east entrance to the Village Center, through the tunnel under the railroad tracks, past the Encampment in Trough and stops just before the two transition points. If you haven't taken care of the two mutants here, you may want to sprint ahead and do that before she gets there (just don't run into the transition point). When Anelia stops, she tells you to meet her in the Agroprom, then turns and disappears.</p>
<p>Now head for the Dark Valley by way of the tunnel where you rescued Anelia from the Bloodsuckers.</p>
<h3 id="darkvalley">Dark Valley</h3>
<p id="glykin">There may be a squad of Mercenaries at the Encampment on Farm in the southwestern corner of the map. If so, they may fire on you and they may not, so save your game before you approach them. Collect Commandant Glykin's PDA, which was Lingov's corpse in the original Clear Sky. This PDA tells you of the 12 PDAs you must collect. The three in the Dark Valley are in the same places as the original Clear Sky. You have one, another at the Encampment at Foothill, and the last one on top of the large storage tank at the Gas Station.</p>
<div>There is a Controller in the Camp amidst some rocks, as well as a Burer and one or two Psuedogiants on the south side of the Freedom base. You can probably avoid the Controller, but I like to take out the Burer and Psuedogiant when I'm done at the Freedom base to make life easier later on. Some Psuedogiants go down with a single RPG while others take four or five. I haven't figured out how to tell the difference yet. You can also use an artifact. Ideally, you should drop the artifact a few yards from the southern wall of the Freedom base, about half way between the overpass and the road where there's a short wall running north and south with an opening in the middle (that's the spot). The Freedom guys don't usually go in that area.</div>
<p>From the Encampment on Farm, you can collect the PDAs and artifacts any way you want. I prefer to go east to the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Fault" target="_blank">Fault anomaly</a>, then to the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Springboard" target="_blank">Springboard anomaly</a> at the southeast corner of the Factory Lobby. This anomaly seems to be buggy, even in the original Clear Sky. I find that sometimes I can get the artifact with no issues by just walking along the southern wall of the factory. Other times, the artifact shows on my detector, but I'm unable to grab it. I've found that if I close the game and reboot, I can then get the artifact. I've even had instances where I've quit for the day and shut down my machine, I can easily grab the artifact the next time I boot the game up. Or, just wait until later in the game, because we'll be back to the Dark Valley a few more times. If you need any help with the stashes, see <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Clear_Sky_Stashes_by_Location#Dark_Valley" target="_blank">Clear Sky Stashes by Location - Dark Valley</a> for walkthroughs.</p>
<p id="valley">From the factory, go along the east side of the wall to the Encampment at Foothill to pick up the PDA los(sic) in Valley laying on a boulder with a mattress against it. Again, there may be a Mercenary or two guarding the camp that you'll have to take out first.</p>
<p id="dvPDAs">Next, make your way to the gas station and get the PDA from the corpse on top of the tank, which is (Uncle Artikular friend's PDA). This is where you went to get the flash drive off of Yar’s friend in the original Clear Sky. If you need help getting the artifact from the top of the north tank, see the Note section for <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gas_Station" target="_blank">Gas Station</a>. This PDA mentions a teleport in a tube at the Mercenary's base, which is marked on your map as the Factory Lobby. But if you try it too soon, the teleport is disabled.</p>
<p>You can go inside the Freedom base now, or wait until you collect the next artifact. The base is under attact by Zombies and you have to clear them out before Ashot the trader appears. Then go to the northwest corner of the camp wall and go west to the fence. Follow the fence north past a bush until, using your minimap, you are directly in line with the two corpses. Take out your detector and move in to grab the artifact, and loot the bodies if you want. Then, turn and go out the same way you came in.</p>
<div id="dvtp">Hidden transition point: North of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Stalker's_grave" target="_blank">Stalker's grave</a> stash that randomly goes to the Bonfire under tree in the Cordon, the factory in Yantar, northeast corner of Agroprom, and the Hide Near Path in the Garbage (which is usually occupied by Bandits, and they are not happy to see you).</div> 
<p>The teleport behind the Factory lobby still doesn't work yet, so once you get all you can, head back to the Garbage by way of the End Outpost transition point.</p>
<h3 id="garbage2">Garbage 2</h3>
<p id="forgotten">In the Garbage, you get a message when you spawn about a toolbox stash (with a PDA inside), which is marked on your map (Forgotten PDA). Switch to your favorite zombie weapon and go to the southeast corner of the Flea Market. As you approach you get a message that it's under attack. The Zombies are in the bottom of the building and if you get there quick enough, they are all bunched together. Don't use an RPG though, because you'll likely take out a Stalker or two as well, and the rest will turn on you. Another group of Zombies may come in from the southwest, too.</p>
<p id="unknown">Once the Flea Market is safe, you'll hear a familiar conversation letting you know those Bandits are waiting for you in the cellar again. You can shoot them through the door and retrieve the PDA of the Unknown. If you hang around the Flea Market, it gets attacked continuously by Bandits. One of the Bandits is Yoha, their leader, and he has a PDA. You can also go to the west end of the Depot and attack the base to get the PDA (which saves some time). I like to loop around to the west side and use the train car to snipe from. You can jump from the top of the tunnel to the train. The doors of the Depot keep opening and closing, so once you have a safe path, get close to the doors so you can get inside and take out Yoha. I saw a video of a player using the fallen pieces of the crane at the southeast corner of the building to get inside, but I can't seem to execute the jump, so I just wait for the doors to open.</p> 
<div>Note: PDA of the Unknown mentions Greek's PDA in the Cordon. I found a video showing a Deserter PDA in the same spot at the original Clear Sky, i.e., the tunnel at the east end of the train tracks. However, judging from the player's inventory in the video, it seems the corpse does not appear until later in the game and I have yet to find it.</div>
<div>Tip: If you take a job from one of the squad leaders at the Flea Market, he sends you to get a Seva suit. There's either a RSF squad that you have to fight off to get the suit, or mutants that you can avoid by looping around to the west. Once you return the suit, check the Flea Market again before you leave the map. Because the Flea Market is under constant attack, you may come back later and find the squad leader's corpse with the Seva suit for your taking.</div>
<p>Next, go to the New Encampment. There are more corpses to the north, if you want to loot them. At this point in the game, I usually have plenty of money and am only interested in ammo and supplies. When you get to the New Encampment, turn to the east and look for a dead tree with a large trunk. Against the southeast side of the trunk is a corpse with the PDA from Garbage, which also tells you of 12 PDAs you need to collect.</p>
<p>Turn west toward the toolbox stash and check your PDA map for Bandits. Once you have the PDA, continue south to the Gas anomaly and collect the two artifacts. There's three more artifacts near the Vehicle Graveyard and, if you haven't already, you'll want to clear out the Bandits in order to collect them. The last artifact is south of the Hideout Near Path. When you're finished collecting artifacts, head for the transition point north of the Flea Market to Army Warehouses. We need to talk to this Looter guy (that Lebedev told us about) in the Mercenaries Bivouac.</p>
<h3 id="army">Army Warehouses</h3>
<div>If you turn around and go back up the road (away from the Army Warehouses) you teleport to the northeast corner of Dark Valley.</div>
<p>Go to a squad leader and ask for a job. He’ll send you to get the Intelligent Service Commander’s PDA. Then check your map and find Looter and go talk to him in his...office. Looter tells you about hiring a former Clear Sky member who then shows on your map as an important person, and he also gives you the task of talking to Forester. You can buy some stashes from Looter, but none of them have any flash drives or PDAs.</p>
<p id="iscPDA">Before retrieving the PDA, there’s a Controller northeast of the village that needs to be removed. Also, be aware of the two Burers at the Water Tower. I once encountered the Controller as I was walking straight from Looter to the PDA. He didn't see me and I was able to take him out before he did. I prefer to use the .50 cal on Controllers and Burers, but you can also use the Dragonov SVD, which takes a few shots, but it works. With the Controller down, switch to the shot gun and get up on the rocks on the west take out the mutants near the corpses. Try for the Chimeras first because they can jump and get you even on the tallest rock. I like to come at them from the west where there’s a smaller rock I can jump up on and shoot between two larger ones. The Chimeras won’t jump at you unless they can see you.</p>
<p>With the mutants out of the way, grab the PDA and read it. You may even want to take a screen shot of it, because you have to return it in order to complete the mission and you can’t take another job without completing this one. Before you leave the area, be sure to scan for artifacts. Also, to the northwest of the Camp Amidst Rocks is a teleport which is currently disabled, but keep it in mind for later in the game.</p>
<p id="ocaPDA">According to the Intelligent Service Commander’s PDA, one of the guys with Looter is a former Clear Sky member and has a PDA with valuable information on it. This is Butcher, whom Looter told you about, and is the blue icon on the east edge of the village on your map. Go talk with him, cap him, and take his PDA, the O'consciousness Agent PDA. Here's why:</p>
<div>On one play through, I noticed his icon was gone and a corpse nearby. Sure enough, Butcher had bought it and he was carrying the O'consciousness Agent PDA. On another playthrough, I brought him an Artifact of Death, because he offered to tell me what to do with them, and he offered no help (maybe I need all three). Since the mission is to collect PDAs, I'm afraid Butcher has to take one for the team. His PDA mentions getting Key's PDA from a Mercenary of his Z-Team. This refers to the <a href="#facCom">Faction Commander</a>, but I haven't figured it out yet.</div>
<p>The rest of the jobs here are optional. There's a squad of Monolith at the Fallen Chopper and one of them may have a .50 cal. If not, check the the Far Farmstead to see if it's occupied by Monolith or Stalkers. Monolith attacks this spot and one of them has a .50 cal. You may even score a Guass. If the Stalkers are still there, check the area at the south end. Again, be sure to scan the area to the north of the Fallen Chopper for artifacts after you clear the Monolith. There's a possible bug with the mission "Return the Jellyfish", where I didn't get credit for returning the item, but when I left the map, I got a message that the mission had failed.</p>
<p>Looting corpses may get you the stash coordinates to the Cross near tree stash, which has some ammo for the Gravi Gun. When you're ready to move on, head for the northwest transition point to the Red Forest. According to Looter, Luke's last known location was with Forester in the Red Forest. Before you jump, get either an RPG or .50 cal ready.</p>
<h3 id="redforest">Red Forest</h3>
<div>If you decide to go down into the lower level of the mine, the only way I've found to get out is to move one of the wooden boxes at the bottom of the ladder where the corpse is (you may need to move him first) and jump to the ladder from the box. So, don't go breaking up all the boxes (I think they're all empty anyway). The passage way that you used in the original Clear Sky is blocked and I've yet to see it open. Usually, there's a bunch of Duty guys trying to walk through it.</div>
<p>I never know for sure what I will find when I spawn in the Red Forest for the first time. The Camp Near Caper is attacked by spiders, or Zombies, or a Burer, or a lone Monolith. Sometimes, the camp is attacked by two or three of these all at once. Here's how I deal with each attack, assuming they aren't happening all at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be a squad of Zombies at the bend in the road up ahead who are about to attack Duty at the gate to the Limansk Reserve. If you have your RPG ready and get close enough, you can take out most of them with one shot. However, (depending on what level you're playing at) there's one Undefeatable Zombie that takes a .50 cal in the head before he goes down.</li>
<li>Another possibility is you’ll hear a swarm of mutant spiders. In this case, find something like a vehicle or shipping crate and jump on top. You can use your shot gun or flamethrower to clear them out.</li> 
<li>A Monolith will sometimes come in from the north of Forester's building (one time he was in the attic of the building to the east and easy pickings).</li>
<li>So far, I’ve encountered a Burer in Forester's building, on the cat walk, and in the road attacking the camp as I came out of Forester's building. Once, he came into the room while I was talking to Forester and killed me before I knew it, then attacked the old man. I've seen it come down the ladder on the east side of the building a few times.</li>
</ul>
<div>If this is the first time you've brought out the flamethrower, you may notice some still pictures of a stalker scaling a wall. This is explained in the <a href="#lukes">Last record in the Luke's brocken PDA</a> when we get to it.</div>
<p>You can expect to encounter each one of these attacts before you head into the forest. It’s usually at this point that I turn my speakers off. Go in, talk to Forester and have him repair any equipment that needs it. He tells you about another PDA, and to stay away from the bridge. If you haven't encountered any of the attacks that I mentioned, you probably will when you leave Forester's building.</p>
<p id="521">Climb the ladder on the east side of the building and remember not to walk on the mess decking. At the top of the ladder, turn to the right where it’s solid (you may have to jump) and go north to the stairs. At the top of the stairs, there's another ladder in front of you. To get to it, you either have to go left, the long way around the building, by walking on the narrow solid section of the decking, or jumping on the handrail and then to the solid deck area at the foot of the ladder. When you get to the top you’ll get hit by an anomaly, but just keep going straight to the next ladder. At the top of this ladder, move to the left to align with the narrow solid section.</p>
<p>On the east side of the building, go past the cable and climb down into the area with boxes. There’s a PDA in one of them, Fivetwentyone's PDA. Be careful of the anomaly on the other side (north) of the area. The boxes on that side are empty.</p>
<p>To get down, the quickest way is to go back to the ladder, climb down at least one of the two ladders and then purposely fall through the decking to the roof. You can go through the decking from where you are, but you’re going to need a vodka to stop the bleeding. Go to the northeast corner of the lowest roof. There’s some sort of tank you can land on, and then to the ground. Also, you can go back the way you came, or jump on the handrail, then to the cable going to the other building and slow-walk down. Move to the lowest part of the roof and walk off (don’t jump or you’ll start bleeding).</p>
<p id="lost">The PDA that Forester told you about is now marked on your map directly south of the northern gate to the forest, near the eastern gate. As you make your way to the spot, there's spiders and Zombies to the east which attact two guys from Duty near an Electro anomally. Sprint for the location of the PDA, and when you get there, jump up on the wall, then to the gate. This gives you a good spot to take out the spiders and Zombies with a shot gun, or whatever weapon you like. If you stay on the wall and don't move up to the top of the gate, the Zombies will knock you off. Save your flamethrower fuel for now. When it's safe, grab the PDA of Lost in Red Forest, which tells you (as does the O'consciousness Agent PDA) to save Azot at the bridge. However, it is very difficult to save Azot and I usually find his corpse either in, or near the tunnel to Limansk. I have successfully saved him and the job he gives me is to return the tank machine gun, which I can get from any squad leader in the Red Forest. When I return with the machine gun, he doesn't give me a reward or another task, so I'm not sure this is a worthwhile venture. Instead, I do some side jobs for Duty in order to get another PDA. Go and ask one of the squad leaders for a job and he'll send you to the tank to retrieve the machine gun. Make sure your inventory can handle another 50 kg or you won't be able to carry the gun back. Then head southeast to the tunnel that leads to the Devilish Encampment, which is marked Mutant's Den on your map. If you're scanning for artifacts, there's three along the west embankment that will be easier to collect on your second trip for the PDA.</p>
<p>There's another group of spiders, rodents, and a Controller waiting in the tunnel marked Mutant's Den on your PDA map. Here are two ways to deal with them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way I've found is to go to the tunnel (armed with the flamethrower) and jump into the second trolley car. Sometimes the tunnel is nearly empty and you may need to shot gun one or two of the rodents to attract the Controller's attention, then switch to the .50 cal (you can kill a Controller with the flamethrower, but it's risky). Check your PDA map to see which end of the tunnel the Controller is at and get ready for it to show itself.</li>
<li>Get as close to the tunnel as possible and attract the spiders’ attention (toss a smoke grenade or something). Then, sprint to the southeast gate (as a reference, there's a transition point just beyond where you need to get to). Just beyond the gate is a truck where you can jump to the bottom of the windshield opening, then climb on top of the truck cab. Make sure you get all the spiders before the Controller shows up. You can hide behind the cab so the Controller can’t get you and lean out with your .50 cal to clear the way. This is a good place to save, because the Controller doesn't always follow the spiders and then you have to go looking for him.</li> 
<li>Another option, instead of the truck, is to use the pile of boulders along the path to the east of the tunnel, about halfway between Dark Yar and Misty Meadow.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the way clear, go through the tunnel and head north to the tank. There’s a group of spiders there which can climb onto the tank, along with some Zombies. However, the rocks to the southeast of the tank make for a great place to shoot them from. The transition point over the tank doesn’t work (which Forester has already warned you about), but the corpses have some ammo and maybe a mini-gun if you don’t already have one. However, you're going to be coming right back to this spot, so if you're near the weight limit in your inventory, wait to loot the corpse on the next trip. When you’re done there, go back to the tunnel and don’t be surprised if you see a couple soldiers on your map. They don’t have any weapons and will run away from you when you get close. There may also be a zombie and one or two spiders in the tunnel, so watch for a red dot on your minimap.</p>
<p id="returned">As you make your way back through the forest, you'll probably encounter more Zombies and spiders. There are a few boulders that are low enough to jump on to, but high enough to keep you safe. These Zombies, however, don't go down easily and I've found using the machine gun from the tank is the best way to deal with them. Take the machine gun back to the squad leader, then ask the other squad leader for a job and he'll send you back to the tank to fetch a PDA. Make sure you read the PDA, or take a screen shot (because you have to give it back to complete the mission). This is the PDA of returned from Limansk.</p>
<p>Now head for the bridge. As you approach, there's a cut scene fly over of the bridge. When it's done, save (so you don't have to cut scene again in case you don't make it). This is another situation where I never know what to expect. The object is to clear out all the trouble-makers for when you come through here later. Strangely, you can walk on the grading of the bridge without falling through. Usually, there's a Burer, Controller, Bloodsucker, Psuedogiant, and spiders. The Psuedogiant can be eliminated with a single RPG. There's also some first aid kits in the lockers on the first floor of the gate house.</p>
<div id="rftp">There are actually three teleports on the east side of the bridge to Limansk:
<ul>
<li>At the back of the tunnel takes you to the Dark Valley overpass.</li>
<li>The far room to the left off the main tunnel is disabled until you return from the Agroprom Underground.</li>
<li>If you walk up the wash-out where the mutants came from, go straight to the guard shack of the bridge and about halfway, turn east to be transported to the Garbage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The truck in the middle of the river has a Gravi Gun in the box behind the cab. To get to it, start from the east side of the bridge and walk out to the end of the broken cement and align yourself with the truck and a broken off pillar in between. Take a standing jump to the pillar, then to the truck. You can also walk off the side of the bridge onto the truck, but you'll take some damage when you land. The gun is behind the cab on the right side (facing the front) and you can go back the same way, except don't try for the bridge from the pillar. Instead, jump to the right of the broken off piece and land on the shore.</p> 
<div>The Gravi Gun can take out most mutants with a single shot. It can also stop a Bloodsucker when it's invisible.</div>
<p>When you're ready to leave the Red Forest, have the guide take you to the Village Center of the Cordon. If no guide is available, use the teleport at the end of the tunnel to Limansk. When you spawn in the Dark Valley overpass, walk forward until the dialog displays and click No. You'll end up outside the overpass, and can go south to the transition point to the Cordon.</p>
<div>Something to try: In my first few games, I used the northern transition point, which also goes to the Dark Valley overpass and found ammo for the Gravi gun there. But it seems this is not a sure thing. Anyway, if you want to try it, here's the alternate walkthrough:
<p>When you're ready, head back through the forest toward the northern transition point. Be sure to stop by and see Forester to get your gear fixed up. As you walk toward the northern transition point, you have to walk past a semi truck and trailer in the road. Instead, jump up on the front bumper, then to the cab and onto the top of the trailer. A pseudodog (sometimes two) spawns at the curve in the road, with a Chimeras right behind it. You can take them out from where you are rather safely. Take care getting down (I go back the way I came) so you don't start bleeding. Once you get to the curve in the road, sprint until the transition point confirmation dialog shows. There's several more Psuedodogs that spawn and it's easier just to run past them.</p>
<p>When you spawn in the Dark Valley overpass, you are facing north with an enlarged area ahead. Go down the planks and smash the wooden box on the right to get some more Gravi Gun ammo (if it's not there, it fell through the floor and is laying on the ground under the overpass where you can pick it up the next time your in the Dark Valley), then continue north be transported back to the bridge in the Red Forest. Go down stairs and have the guide take you to the Village Center of the Cordon.</p></div>
<p>And now we can go see Sidorovich. This will cost you 4000 RU and about 10 minutes of your life you’ll never get back. But you only get one shot at this, i.e., you can't go back later for a second visit. At one point, there’s a cut scene dialog in, what I assume to be, Russian. Neither that nor the English dialog offer any help as near as I can tell. However, I got a tip from stalker Jesse Roy about the portal in Sidorovich's back room (that I couldn't figure out how to get to). Jump up on the ledge in front of Sidorovich, low-crouch and walk through the opening. As you approach the doorway to the next room you are transported to the Chernobyl NPP.</p>
<div>Sheluden's PDA mentions a flash drive in Sidorovich's hole, but I haven't found it yet. You can't kill Sidorovich, and you die the instant you kill one of the guards.</div>
<h3 id="cnpp">Chernobyl NPP</h3>
<p>After the cut scene, you are in a tunnel with a transition point at the end and a timer in the lower-left of your screen (if you take too long you'll fail the mission). Walk up to about half way and start looking through the scope of your Guass, Barrett, or Dragunov to the left. There's snipers on the roofs and stairs in the distance, mostly using Dragunovs (you can get their ammo later, so don't worry if you're getting low). You want to take as many of them out as you can to make this next part a little easier. When you get to the section of the tunnel where you can just see the stairs by leaning right, you're very close to the teleport. Then change to a grenade launcher, go through the teleport, sprint forward until you get to the metal plate and crouch down on the left side of the roof vent (to avoid any remaining snipers).</p>
<p>This looks familiar, only these guys are packing SVUmk-2's and .50 cal's, both of which can take you out with one shot. There's three RSF at the other end of the roof. Once you take these guys out, check the stairs, which is now ahead and to the right (southwest), for any snipers you may have missed.</p>
<p>Just as in the original Clear Sky, as you advance toward the next teleport, two more RSF spawn when you approach the step in the roof, sometimes at either end. Finally, three more as you reach the last row of roof vents before the transition point. I recommend hiding behind a steal plate and quick saving after you take out the first and second wave. Then, you can either sprint to the transition point or try for the third wave and collect some .50 cal ammo. Again, take too long and you'll fail the mission.</p>
<p>Next you land on a walkway with a transition point at the end. Another sniper spawns behind you as you pass the curved duct on the right. The next teleport takes you to the roof of the building with the teleport at the opposite corner and three waves of Monolith spawn, some wearing ghost suits. After you fight off the first wave, you have two options:<ul>
<li>Collect some ammo and go - If you stay near the north and west edges of the roof, you can loot corpses without triggering the next wave.</li>
<li>Get as much ammo as you can - Once again, take too long and you fail the mission. After collecting as much as you can without triggering the next wave, move to the structures in the middle of the roof with ribs on the sides for cover. Then, for the third wave, sprint to the south end of the roof to the same type of structure.
</ul>
When you're ready, go to the northern rail where the teleport displays on your minimap. Looking down, you can see a platform with the teleport at its northern end. You can either jump into the teleport, or move to the southern end of the platform and find the hidden ladder to climb down. The teleport takes you to the Agroprom Underground where you encountered a Controller before you could reach the valve to flood the lower level in the original Clear Sky. Now there's Pyrogeists, Bloodsuckers, and Zombies, in addition to some serious psy emission columns. There's an unmaked transition point on the other side of the room just before you get to the gated door that takes you to the Agroprom Research Institute. You have to use the curved outer walkways because you'll fall through the straight ones. I like to take the one on the right about a quarter way around and grab the Gravi Gun ammo, then double back to avoid the Bloodsucker and go to the next circle. You want to get to the gate as quickly as you can.</p>
<h3 id="agroprom2">Agroprom 2</h3>
<p>You spawn on top of the west elevator shaft of the Agroprom Research Institute, which is under attack by Zombies. For some reason, you can't climb down the ladder to the next level of the roof and have to jump. Plus, the inside stairways are both blocked off. But you can use the ladder on the south side of the building over by the east elevator shaft. There is a group of Zombies coming out of a building north of the trading post entrance. They seem impervious to everything but a shot gun or mini-gun. Even RPGs are useless against them, and I'm usually out of fuel for the flamethrower by this point. After taking out the group, there's another one coming up the road that runs along the west of the base, and still more coming in from the Northern Entrance. When you have finished clearing the Zombies outside the main building, the front door opens to reveal another group in the front hall.</p>
<p>Once all these Zombies are gone, you can trade with Lentyay (the trader) and (optionally) buy some stashes. Although, I have had it happen where the trader and technician don't return right away, or even until I leave the map and return.</p> 
<p id="ocPDA">The Joker of Horror flash drive mentions the shooting range at the Agroprom, and that's where Korsakov is. When he asks if you want to take the shooting challenge, click "No time for games right now. Maybe later." Then ask Korsakov if he has any stashes and he sells you Joker's stash, which is the location of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Under_cross" target="_blank">Under cross</a> stash in the original Clear Sky, which is located in the northeast corner of the map. Only this time there's a Controller guarding it, who is usually on the east side (outside) of the fence in the meadow. The stash contain five Scientific Med kits, a Bubble artifact, three Anti-rad kits, and a sweet little Svarog detector prototype. I also discovered I now had the O'consciousness PDA.</p>
<h3 id="agunderground">Agroprom Underground</h3>
<p id="mohnat">Head for the factory and ask a squad leader for a job. He will ask you to return Stalker Mohnat's PDA. There's two artifacts in the factory's east building, top floor. The trader at the factory is Beard (a long way from the Skadovsk). Go see Wanderer in Hermit's hole and he will offer you a job getting a PDA from the log cabin in the swamp. It's an easy job with one bandit that you can take out with a sniper rifle through the doorway from a safe distance. If you're lucky, There's an artifact in the Symbiont anomaly southwest of the cabin and another one in the water to the north.</p>
<p id="loghouse">Once you have the PDA (PDA from loghouse on the swamp, Agroprom) read it and then take it back to Wanderer. Sometimes he takes it from you and sometimes he doesn't. So be sure to at least read it, or take a screen shot. Buy Wanderer's only stash, which is PDA of Stalker, Dead In the Underground. Next, you need to talk to Vivisector, who is near the northwest transition point to Yantar. Stay up along the east ridge of the valley to avoid being transition pointed to Yantar. If you get the dialog to teleport, click No and you'll have to climb up either side of the valley to try and get around the teleport again. Vivisector is at the very edge of the map. He informs you of how to get into the Underground.</p>
<p>The minimap points you to the Underground Entrance on top of the hill northeast of the Agroprom Institute. When you spawn inside the chamber, remember that you can't walk on the grading, but you can walk on the rails. Once you get to the ground floor, go through the doorway and follow the hall to the left. Put your gun away because there's an anomaly that may cause you to drop it part way through. The easiest way is to go around the barrel on the left and stay against the left wall and sprint until you are next to the pillar. Just before you get there you loose your bearings, so just stop until you can see your way again. Advance to where the hall narrows again and take out your RPG. Go up to the doorway, staying against the right wall until you're there, then side-step left and let the Zombies have it, get back out of the doorway, and switch to the .50 cal. Check the room for an Undefeatable Zombie.</p>
<p>Move to the left and go through the doorway, staying to the left. The next doorway on the right has another anomaly, so you may want to put your gun away before going through. But first, check the room for another Zombie. If you don't see him, or he hasn't come after you, he's probably in the corner on the right. Go through the doorway, take out your Monstrpress and let him have it. Then switch to the .50 cal. There's one Undefeatable Zombie through the next door, and a regular Zombie behind him. If you take too long with them you might have to deal with a Psuedogiant before you're ready to.</p> 
<p>Mohnat's PDA is at the end of the hall, but you have to get past the Psuedogiant, and this one takes more than one RPG. For this, I recommend a Wrenched artifact to set up a small gravi anomaly. The Wrenched has a small radius of 7, but is powerful enough to take out the Psuedogiant. If you haven't used an artifact as a weapon yet, put it in place of your secondary weapon and hold down the fire button until the artifact leaves your hands. Then, get away from it and try to get the Psuedogiant to walk through the anomaly once it's going good (it takes a few seconds to get cranked up). You can sprint past the anomaly, but the Psuedogiant can't. Once he becomes red confetti, go to the end of the hall and down the stairs. The PDA is in a backpack under the stairs. If you need help finding it, see <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Backpack_under_stairs" target="_blank">Backpack under stairs</a>. Then up the ladder to Strelok's stash, take out the flamethrower (even if you don't have any fuel), and save your game.</p>
<p id="lukes">When you get close to the door on the right side of the room, you teleport into a room with Luke lying on the floor and a timer starts. According to the O'consciousness Agent PDA, you have to climb the ladder in the circular room to turn off the timer. If you bought stashes, you may see two of them along the way, but don't take the time to get stashes now. We'll be back later to get all that. Also, don't talk to Luke (unless you click through the conversation quickly so that it's recorded in your PDA Messages). Grab the flamethrower fuel, and go up the ladder, through the door and turn the valve on the left. Then, cook the Zombies at the door while you wait for it to open and sprint to the other end of the room, down the steps and turn left down the hallway like in Shadow of Chernobyl. Stay to the left side and use the flamethrower to get past the giant rodents, go up the ladder and wait for the rodents to leave. Save again, climb down and go back the way you came to pick up the PDA of Stalker, Dead In the Underground, which is in the backpack at the bottom of the circular stars. Go up the stairs and back to where you left Luke to get his PDA, the Last record in the Luke's brocken PDA. Then turn around and go back to where you climbed the ladder, only go past the ladder and walk through the gate. Stay along the wall to avoid any remaining rodents and when you come to the end of the hallway you are transported to the overpass in Dark Valley.</p>
<div id="fdagunder">Luke's PDA mentions a flash drive in the Yantar factory complex. It's located at the bottom of the stairs which led to <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Lab_X-16' target="_blank">Lab X16</a>. Also, the disabled teleport in the tunnel to Limansk is now operational and takes you to CNPP.</div>
<!--Dark Valley Overpass Flashdrives-->
<h3 id="dv2">Dark Valley 2</h3>
<p>You spawn inside the Dark Valley Overpass, which consists of three rooms connected by a walkway, and you are in (or near) the north room. No matter which direction you take, you transition point to another map, and we don't want to leave just yet. There's someone we need to talk to at the north end of the overpass. There's a wooden box on the floor of the room (where the floor drops down) and it contains the <a href="#yantarteles">Flash drive with data on hidden trasition point on the Yantar</a>. Then move forward and when the dialog comes up about transporting, click No and get tossed out of the overpass.</p>
<p>Start inside the base at the southeast corner of the incomplete building, which is on the west side of the Freedom Base, i.e., the west entrance. Follow the complex wall south until you reach a wall panel leaning against another panel. There's just enough room for you to crouch down and get between the panels into the unused part of the complex, then go around and in the building on the left to talk to First Stalker. He tells you there are four flash drives in the overpass with information on hidden transition points and a not-so-helpful strategy on how to get them. When you're done talking with First Stalker, go up to the top of the ladder to the overpass, turn and jump onto the ledge above First Stalker. There's a case of ammo for a Gravi Gun at the far end.</p>
<p id="fdcordon">Now you can check teleport in the drain pipe at the Abandoned Factory. Shoot one of the barrels from a safe distance to clear the way. This takes you to the north end of the overpass and the <a href="#cordon3">Flash drive with data of hidden trasition point on the Cordon</a>. The radiation is pretty high here, so don't take time to read it. If you move either north or south you teleport to the Bonfire under tree. Instead, click No again and head back to the Army Warehouses by way of the End Outpost transition point.</p>
<h3 id="army2">Army Warehouses 2</h3>
<p>Go to the transition point in the northeast corner of the map near the Hideout in dry woods. This is a tricky one because if you don't follow this path you get hit with a fatal psy emission. First, if you haven't been here already, you'll need to clear out the mutants. The bull dozer is a good vantage point for this. Next, locate the Stop sign laying in the road along the line of stakes with skulls. Turn left and go up to the rock face, then right and stay along the rock face until you get to the large boulder on the right. Turn to the right facing the road and align yourself to go between the two trees and over the smallest boulder between the road and a large boulder, then sprint for the little boulder.</p>
<p>This transition point takes you back to another spot in the overpass of Dark Valley, just south of the middle room. The box behind you has the next flash drive, <a href="#agropromtele">Flash drive with data of hidden trasition point on the Agroprom</a>.</p>
<p>If you go north, you teleport to the Bonfire Under Tree in the Cordon. South takes you to random places in the Garbage, some safe, some not (but you never know until you get there). Instead, click No in the teleport dialog and again make your way back to the Red Forest by way of the End Outpost transition point of the Dark Valley, Northern Outpost of the Garbage, and the Far Fortification Point of the Army Warehouses. 
When you spawn in the Red Forest, turn around and head back to the transition point. You can either try to out run the mutants again, or jump up on the semi and eliminate them before moving on. This time when you spawn in the Dark Valley overpass, turn south. This teleport was disabled the first time we came here, but now is working.</p>
<p id="desire">You are transported to the secret room of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">Gastronom</a> in Limansk. There, you find the Black artifact of a Desire, a flamethrower and fuel, the Exoskeleton suit mentioned in Luke's friend's PDA, and ammo for the Gravi Gun. When you move around the room a transition point dialog displays. However, I found that unless I am directly in front of the control panel, the game crashes. If it doesn't, you spawn in the hospital with a message that the enemy can't see you (as long as you don't walk in front of the machine gun). Instead make your way south on the second floor until you are behind the barrier with the machine gun. There's someone we need to talk to around the corner, the Unnamed Scientist. When you finish the conversation, the Unnamed Scientist will upgrade that new Exoskeleton suit you just found at no cost (along with anything else that might need fixin'). Then, go through the transition point and end up back at the Vehicle Station in the Cordon.</p>
<div>Unlike the original Clear Sky, you can sprint in the Exoskeleton suit. In fact, with two or three Goldfish artifacts on your belt, you can sprint a long way.</div>
<h3 id="anelia">Anelia</h3>
<p>The transition point to the Agroprom from the north end of the Swamps now works. Take the transition point by the Bonfire in Forest to the Swamp, and then to the Agroprom to return Mohnat's PDA. Then go find Anelia.</p>
<p>The easiest way to find Anelia is to go to the Outpost by the Hole and head southwest until she shows up on your minimap. If the outpost is unpopulated, you'll have a few Snorks to deal with, and be sure to check the hole for a few shy ones. This is necessary because Anelia will come back this way, and if Anelia dies, you die. This is also the spot where Meatgrinder's men set up camp. If they are there, Anelia will go straight north to the road and avoid the outpost.</p>
<p>West of the anomaly, find Anelia sitting by the fence, but save before you approach her. When you stand next to her for a few seconds she stands up and goes either north or northeast and eventually toward the Fork in the Road. From there, Anelia goes north past the Eastern Outpost of the Institute complex to the enbankment that runs east and west on the other side of the railroad tracks. There's a pack of blind dogs near the fallen tree, so sprint ahead to clear the out, but not so far as to lose Anelia.</p>
<p>Anelia goes up the embankment and straight north to the fence, then turns left (west) and goes to the transition point to Yantar. As you go along the fence, be ready for blind dogs, psuedodogs, and spiders. When you get near the transition point, which is marked with an opening in the fence, stop and let Anelia go ahead until she disappears. If you teleport too soon, she sits down right where she is and you have to this map over.</p>
<div>I found getting through the factory complex to be very challenging, so I tried leaving Anelia at the spawn point while I cleared the way, but the Zombies respawned even before I could get back to her. I have found two spots where a reload doesn't result in Anelia going back to the starting point of the map: 1) When she gets to the Bivouac Under Shed. 2) At the southeast corner of the factory complex (just before you enter the front gate). I also found that if you load a save too many times it becomes corrupt and the game crashes. So, you may want to save at both spots. </div>
<p>When you spawn in Yantar and Anelia is behind you and you have to go east or west far enough to get around the transition point, then stand next to her to get her moving. When you meet up with Anelia and follow her to the transition point, click No and she continues toward the Scientist's Camp, then turns east. You just have to follow her as she zigzags through the southeastern part of the map. There's a group of Zombies on the Island in Swamp, and usually several more in the Scientist's Camp. It's best to avoid contact if you can until you get near the factory. Also, you're going to need several RPG rounds to get through the factory complex. There's a group of Zombies at the Power Transformer Booth that you may be able to clear out with an RPG as you pass by to the south. And don't be surprised if she walks through the Springboard anomaly near the Secret Entrance.</p>
<p> When she starts up the ramp of the Secret Entrance, go on ahead to the east and hit the Zombies near the Garages near Parimeter and Power Transformer Booth (if you haven't already). Most of the Zombies can be taken out with an RPG round, but the Undefeatable Zombies (usually wearing an Exoskeleton suit) may need a head shot from the .50 cal.</p>
<p>Inside the complex, the Zombies wearing lab coats are armed shot guns and like to wait until you get close to them before they start shooting. There's a Monolith sniper on the roof of the Hanger, and a Bloodsucker comes in from the right from the overhead crane area. Another Monolith sniper on the roof to the right across from the Hanger. Turn the corner to the Factory Backyard and you should be safe. The transition point is a gate with a three-circle emblem blocking the road with a small people gate. Again, don't go through the transition point until Anelia disappears.
</p>
<p>You both spawn in the southeast corner of the map. Fortunately, Anelia stays to the outer edge of the forest where it's easy to protect her. However, she does go through a few radiation hot spots, so watch your meters. I have had it happen that the spiders and Controller that I took care of during my first trip to the Red Forest, decided to respawn and I had to sprint away from Anelia so she would return to the starting point, and use the rocks on the south side of the Dark Yar to clear the way again.</p>
<p>Once Anelia gets near the Bloodsucker's Resting Place, she stops every ten feet or so to check for artifacts, even inside the mine. Finally, she goes to the back of the mine and waits by the fire until you bring her father, Galetskiy, to her.</p>
<p>Now back to the CNPP by way of the teleport in the room off to the left of the main tunnel to Limansk. This puts you above the building where you saved Gunslinger. Jump down off the crain and go to the teleport in the southeast corner of the roof. This puts you on the overpass that extends to the east of the building you teleported from.</p> 
<p>Instead, (and this part is optional) I found that at this point I could take the time to loot corpses, so I took the overpass east, then south and up the ladder. There's a Pyrogeist about halfway up the stairs directly across the roof which can be taken out with a minigun. You should have plenty of ammo if you've been picking up machine guns along the way. Then go over to one of the structures near the landing of the stairs, jump up to the ledge of one of the ribs on the sides, then to the top. Sprint and jump to the landing and quickly jump again to get over the rail (before you fall off the ledge). Once you've collected all you want from the snipers you took out the first time you where here, go west to where the first three snipers where. If you look north on the ground, you may see Gunslinger under the overpass. You may also see some Clear Sky fighting with Monolith. You can use some of those sniper rounds you just picked up to help them out.</p>
<p>When you're ready to leave, take the teleport next to the overpass where it forks. This takes you into the tunnel at the south end of Limansk.</p>
<h3 id="limansk">Limansk</h3>
<p>Make your way over the rubble at the end and drop down into the next part. When the dialog displays, click No. In fact, during one play through I had to click No multiple times before I got past the van and into the southern edge of Limansk. There's a Bandit in the same spot as the two Bandits were in the original Clear Sky, one in need of a med kit. There's another unarmed Bandit wondering around that doesn't attack, but I popped him anyway. Follow the same path as you did in the original Clear Sky, avoiding the Bandit ambush, and clear out the house as you did before. Don't forget the stash of VOG-25 grenades upstairs. Also, there's a Poltergeist that may come down the street. Use the machine gun nest and a mini-gun to make it go away, permanately.</p>
<p id="fdgarbage">Be sure to check the corpse(s) in and around the house to find the Flash drive with data of hidden trasition point on the Garbage. Approach the courtyard carefully. There may be another Poltergeist, two Burers (unless you took them out before if you used the <a href="yantarteles">Yantar transition point</a>), and an assortment of mutants waiting for you. Find a place where you can snipe the Burers with your .50 cal, like the top of the light blue and white bus. Then switch back to your favorite mutant eliminator.</p>
<p>Before you start looting all those corpses, there's three machine gunners on a balcony to the north of the courtyard that are waiting for you to get in range, which is about the south wall of the deli on your right (looking north). Once they are down, you can move about the courtyard freely. However, if you're playing at a higher level, you may get a visit from a Monolith patrol coming from the north. If you go into the basement of the deli (on the south side of the building) you'll find Galetskiy.</p>
<div>There are two U-shaped buildings which face each other on either side of the square with the fountain. On the east side is the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/File:Deli.jpg" target="_blank">deli</a> and on the west is the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">Gastronom</a> building.</div>
<h3 id="galetskiy">Galetskiy</h3>
<p>Take Galetskiy back to his daughter by way of the the tunnel where you both teleport back to the Red Forest. Only, Galetskiy spawns at the other end of the tunnel, i.e., the west side of the bridge. You, on the other hand, spawn on top of the tank and are surrounded by Zombies and spiders. When you spawn, you are facing north, so turn and sprint south to the Devilish Encampment and save your game. Go through the Mutant's Den (which may have some more spiders and another Controller, or even two) and then west to the bridge. Cross the bridge and find Galetskiy in his usual position, cowering in the corner. Talk to him to get him to stand up, then let him go over the bridge first. For some reason, the Clear Sky guys shoot at him, but eventually he moves into the woods where he, like his daughter, stops constantly to check his imaginary detector. You can save when ever Galetskiy stops, which will save you from having to go through it all again if the game crashes on you (yeah, it happen to me right at the end when I was just about to get the stash information from Anelia). With Galetskiy, reloading doesn't send him back to the beginning of the maplike it does with the others. Between stops, Galetskiy advances to the mine. However, if he sees anyone along the way in the woods, he vanishes.</p>
<p id="blood">When Galetskiy finally gets to the back of the mine, there's some strange behavior that takes place. He approaches Anelia, who is laying by the fire, and then stands over her like a statue with his finger pointing toward the mine opening. Go over to Anelia (I guess you have to wake her up). She gets up and runs into the next room. When she comes back you can talk to her and she gives you the coordinates to the Black artifact of Blood. And then they both vanish. The location of the stash is the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Crate_with_backpack" target="_blank">Crate with backpack</a> of the original Clear Sky, which is along the east shore just south of the bridge to Limansk. In the stash is also Anelia's PDA, which tells you about Zarka in Zaton, who you are now tasked to find.</p>
<h3 id="limansk2">Limansk 2</h3>
<p>Go over the bridge and use the teleport to CNPP, which is in the side tunnel to the south. From there, use the teleport to Limansk again. If you happened to get close to the front of the deli during your first visit, or even now, Lotsman sends you some instructions on how to meet him on the top floor (remember him from the Clear Sky base in Swamp?). But we need to clear the way first, and come back to meet him. From the deli, follow the road north until the anomaly that seems to block the road. There's an iron gate to the right with a few bars missing so you can get through. Then turn left and continue north. When you get to the car, turn northeast and go up the long flight of stairs. Make your way through the house and out the north side where you'll see a bridge over a canal and the House on hill on the other side.</p>
<div>There are three Burers total in this area, along with a squad of Zombies. I've encountered the Burers as far south as the canal and as far north as the construction site. The Zombies are usually somewhere near the Space Bubble anomaly maze.</div>
<p id="fdlimansk">The House on hill is occupied by Monolith. You can easily bypass this fortification by turning to the left when you get to the bridge and walking through the fence and then crossing the canal. However, if you approach the house from the west, you should be able to pick them off one by one, starting one in the doorway and the other in the window. Then move up to the house and shoot through the windows, working your way around the back of the house, then inside. Being able to walk through fences has its advantages.</p>
<p>Once you're done making and checking corpses, exit on the west side of the house, through the fence and between the buildings where you'll find the Space Bubble anomaly maze. You can go through the maze without having to avoid the anomalies because they don't work. For some reason you can't get into the bus, but you can jump on top of it. As you approach the construction site, Lotsman sends a message about the doctor on the top floor.</p>
<p id="scarPDA">One scientist shows up as friendly and gives you the location of Scar's PDA when you ask him for a job, so don't kill him. But the guy at the top, according to Lotsman, needs to go down. If you try to approach him you get teleported to a very great height and splat somewhere in the woods. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Construction_Site#Walkthrough" target="_blank">my walkthrough</a> if you need a strategy for clearing out the construction site. Once you've cleared the site and taken out the guy on the top floor, ask the friendly scientist for a job and he tells you to return Scar's PDA. Then go back to the square with the fountain and all the bodies.</p>
<p id="fdCNPP">On the north side of the Gastronom building is an arched doorway with two doors. The one on the left leads to the basement, where there's some Gravi Gun ammo and a teleport. This takes you back to the Dark Valley overpass where you'll find the fourth flash drive, Flash drive with data of hidden trasition point on the CNPP. Go north to teleport out of the overpass to the Camp at Bottom of Ravine. If you go south, well, it doesn't end well. From the ravine, you can check the Duty base and factory for a guide to take you to the Swamp, or head south to the transition point to the Cordon and then to the Bonfire in Forest transition point.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get to the PDA from the Northern Farmstead is to follow the railroad tracks along the north of the Swamp. Follow them west until you reach the corpse, grab the PDA, and find a guide that can take you to the Limansk Bridge. Otherwise, you have to go back to Sidorovich or take a long walk north to the bridge by way of Agroprom, Yantar, and then the Red Forest transition point in the Factor Backyard.</p>
<p>Once you get to the square in Limansk, you want to pick up your old buddy Lotsman.</p>
<h3 id="lotsman">Meet Lotsman</h3>
<p>Lotsman's instructions are as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Jump on the pick-up at the other side of the street...</li>
<li>Then to the fence...</li>
<li>From the fence to the porch roof...</li>
<li>From that roof to the other building roof...</li>
<li>Jump to the tree...</li>
<li>To the balcony</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="construction">The pick-up directly across the street (west) from the deli is near a brick wall. Climb up the front bumper, hood, and roof, then jump to the wall and walk to the northeastern corner post. If you want an easy artifact, jump down on the west side of the wall and walk south with your detector to find an anomaly on the ground. Look up and you'll see a Night Star on the balcony (which we can get once we're on the roof). Circle the building to the south, through the fence and get back to the truck. Once you are back to the norhteastern corner post, align yourself diagonally with the porch roof of the building to the north of the truck, but stay slightly to the right so you don't hit the tree when you jump. You need to be able to step once and then jump to make it to the roof. If you make it, you may want to quick save before moving on. Next, stand on the peak of the roof and jump to the main roof of the building. Go to the west end of the roof and sprint-jump to the roof southwest of you. Go to the other end of that roof and sprint-jump to the Gastronom building, where you used the teleport in the basement to go back to Dark Valley and collected the fourth flash drive. Now you can get that Night Star.</p>
<p>Move east along the wall to pick up some supplies, then continue around to the porch roof on the east side of the southern part of the building. If you still have your detector out, you can see a glow in the last window. Jump up on the window ledge and crouch to get the Goldfish artifact. Then go back to the north part of the building, where there's three chimneys. If you walk on the south side of the northern chimney, there's a tree branch that you can walk on directly from the roof. Take that branch to where it joins a larger branch, then turn to the right and down to the next crotch where there's a branch from the tree reaching in from the east. Continue east through the second tree until the branch angles down and jump to the third tree. Continue east to a branch that reaches out near the southwest corner of the deli's roof. Sprint-jump to the roof, walk slowly off the roof at an angle (otherwise you might overshoot) to the balcony and through the door to meet Lotsman. He tells you of a teleport on the roof of the construction site and agrees to follow you there.</p>
<p>After your conversation with Lotsman, he turns and walks through the wall, leaving you to find your own way out. Step off the balcony rail onto the van roof to minimize damage and wait for Lotsman to come through the front door of the deli. Lead him to the House on the Hill, then follow him to the top of the construction site. He tells you the teleport is on the cement slab hanging from the crane, which is on the west side of the building, then he disappears.</p>
<p id="bonus">Before taking the teleport, let's return Scar's PDA to complete the task. When you do, you get the Bonus PDA, which instructs you to take a screenshot of it, then go to the north wall of the construction site. Be careful of the sniper in the tower.</p>
<h3 id="monolith">Monolith</h3>
<p>You may have noticed a sniper taking shots at you as you were moving about the construction site before. There's more Monolith waiting in the building to the northeast, the courtyard in front of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Radiowave_Institute" target="_blank">Radiowave Institure</a>, and in the tower. You can take most of them out from the construction site with a Dragunov or Guass. There's also some mutants and a little surprise inside the build to the northeast. I had to use a Gravi artifact placed in the dug out area where you go under the northern gate of the construction site to get rid of the Psuedogiant, which takes a single RPG round. </p>
<p id="PDAPriplusovannys">Approach the building to the northeast where all the Monolith came from carefully. If any Monolith come out, waste them. Once inside, you'll find some guys that cannot be killed, but they don't attack either. There's one in an Exoskeleton suit named Giga Programmer. Tell him you want to join Monolith and he gives you a flash drive with instructions on how to get Priplusovanny's PDA, which is back in Zarton. Nice little plot twist, eh? Now you have to go back and clear out the Clear Sky camp. There's two other guys in the next room, a trader and a technician.</p>
<div>Yhe transition point at the north end takes you to the barracks of the Military outpost in the south of the Cordon, and they are not happy to see you.</div>
<p>According to the <a href="#valley">PDA los in Valley</a>, there's another PDA in Yantar we need to get, along with three flash drives (I've only found one). So head back to the tunnel transition point. As before, you teleport to the tank in the Red Forest. Make your way through the woods to the gate where you collected the <a href="#lost">PDA of Lost in Red Forest</a>. Follow the road south until you get to the fallen tree blocking the road. Look south through you .50 cal scope to find a Controller. Once he's down, there are two Psuedodogs that spawn as you get about halfway to the Controller's corpse. Continue south on the road until you teleport to Yantar.</p> 
<h3 id="yantar2">Yantar 2</h3>
<p>Go east to the yellow dot on your PDA map marked Factory Backyard, the building you entered to get to Lab X16 in the original Clear Sky. The door is closed, so you have to go around the opposite side of the building where there's a hole in the wall for you to enter. Go in down to the bottom of the stairs. One of the two boxes contains the <a href="#fdagunder">Flash drive with data of hidden trasition point on the Agroprom Underground</a>.</p>
<p id="lukesfriend">The PDA is in the northwest corner of the map near the place marked Uprooted Tree. There's a Burer, mutants, and Zombies waiting for you, too. My strategy is to take out the Burer with the .50 cal, then switch to the RPG and fire a couple rounds at the mutants. Then, switch to the shot gun and head down the hill where there's no tall brush so you can see the rodents that come at you. Once the mutants are out of the way, go back up the hill and finish off any remaining Zombies with a sniper rifle. Once the area is clear, get the artifact from the anomaly and the PDA of Luke's friend.</p>
<div><h3 id="yantarteles">Yantar transition points</h3>
<p>The transition point is next to the tree the Zombies were standing near. When you spawn in Limansk, you're inside the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">deli overlooking the courtyard</a>, looking north. There are three transition points in the room you're in. There's a hidden one to the right that sends you back to Yantar with no dialog to opt out of being transported. The other two take you to the CNPP.</p>
<p>The other transition point is northeast of the swamp at the southeastern corner of the factory complex. There's a green crate (steamer trunk) next to the shed directly south of the transition point. Jump up on the crate, then the roof of the shed and over the wall. The transition point takes you back to the Clear Sky base in the Swamp.</p></div>
<h3 id="clear">Clear Sky Base</h3>
<p>When you spawn in the Clear Sky base, you get a message that the former leader of O'consciousness and the Clear Sky leader are both dead. You may notice green dots on your minimap. These are the mutants that Bashnya has tamed and you have to take them out. The only Clear Sky members you can spare are the trader (who still trades with you) and the bar tender (the technician is gone). Once you finish with the base, you get a message telling you to go to the Jupiter Underground.</p>
<p>Go to the northeast transition point, which takes you to the Cordon. Avoid being seen by the rookies in the Village Center and use the teleport in Sidorovich's back room again. Make your way to the teleport to Limansk, then to the construction site and teleport to the Jupiter Underground. 
Getting to the slab before the hanging slab is tricky because you can easily hit your head and not make the jump. The teleport takes you to the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Jupiter_Underground" target="_blank">Jupiter Underground</a> from Call of Pripyat.</p>
<h3 id="jup">Jupiter Underground</h3>
<p>There's a group of Zombies on the other side of the truck where you first spawn, plus a Pyrogeist roaming around. Follow the passage south carefully, using the vehicles as cover from the Zombies along the way. When you come to where the passage branches to the right and dead-ends, another Pyrogeist starts at you, with a Psuedogiant right behind. There are two trucks back-to-back across the passage where you can jump up on top to deal with the Pyrogeist (I prefer the minigun, but a shot gun works, too). The Psuedogiant should be somewhere near the trucks so you can deploy another Gravi artifact or several RPG rounds to take it out.</p>
<p>Stay on the left side walkway and jump up on the shipping container. There's a fence with three corpses and a few more further south. Only, some are really sleeping Zombies that wake up as soon as you walk by them. Shooting them with anything other than the Gravi Gun is a waste of ammo (they go down, but get right back up again). If you haven't encountered the invisible spiders yet, toss a grenade or two near the doorway on the left. Also, by now you are probably in a Controller's Aura by now. When the way is clear, jump down the south side of the container, jump up on the next container and get your .50 cal ready for the Controller to come through the door. You may get a couple more spiders, too. Again, when the way is clear, jump down and sprint through the door and down two flights of stairs. There may one armed Zombie along the way here, so be ready for it.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, turn right, jump up on the locomotive and climb to the top where you can use a shot gun or minigun on the Psuedodogs and Snorks. You might even get a chance to cap the Burer if it comes in from the large circular room to the south. The Zombies are unarmed and easy to out run, but if you want to be rid of them, the Gravi Gun is the only thing I've found knocks them down for good.</p> 
<p id="zarkaPDA">In the large circular room, there's a squad of Patrol Time who carry a semi-automatic Gauss and any mutants, Burer, Controller, etc. that you didn't deal with before. Also, there's an Exoskeleton in a crate that's located in a room south of the entrance to the overhead control room, which is on the west side of the circular room. This next part you may want to save for the next time through because the jump is a tricky one. Go to the platform with the generator on top (where you had to power up the generator to open the door in Call of Pripyat). Climb on top of the generator and either next to, or on top of the tank on the south end. Sprint-jump to the ledge west of the generator and go to the ramp. The object is to get inside the Control Room, and you can do this three ways:
<ol>
<li>Go halfway up the ramp, turn to the right and jump to the cat walk that leads to the Control Room.</li>
<li>Go to the top of the ramp and fall through the opening in the cat walk.</li>
<li>Go to the top of the ramp, follow the cat walk around to the top of the Control Room and drop down to the planks that lead to the open window of the Control Room.</li>
</ol>
Inside the Control Room on the control panel is Zarka's PDA. When you're done exploring, return to the end of the passage and up the ladder to spawn back in Limansk.</p>
<p>At the top of the circular room, stay on the south rail of the overhead crane and take the ramp south. At the top of the ramp, turn left and go to the next room. In the southeast corner of the room is a teleport that takes you to the north side of the circular room. Follow the cat walk to the next room.</p>
