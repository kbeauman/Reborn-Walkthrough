1. The teleport in the clear sky base behind the shopkeeper appears to go to the dark valley, I only tried it once so it may go to other places. you have to kill the shopkeeper then jump through the counter to the back room similar to Sidorovich.


2. After leaving the Jupitor base, make sure to finish off any dealings with the current factions, as you have to join the monolith to proceed with the gameline.


3. Join the monolith then get to clear sky base, (teleport at top of flea market very usful) then proceed to kill all of the mutants and clear sky members appart from the barman and the shopkeeper. This then opens another teleport in Jupiter base.


4. Once in Jupitor base again, procced threough as before until you are in the interior train yard. Finish dealing with the Time patrol and loot the guns, (I assume you will need them for the return to Zotan?) Follow the electric cables overhead until you find the platform with the transformer. There is a ladder to the side, climb onto the transformer then jump straight ahead onto the circular walkway. Follow the walkway around using the wooden planks to navegate to higher levels. Stop off at the control room and pick up Zarka's PDA then continue going up until you are ontop of the crane rails at the very top. Walk along the wooden plank and then onto the final circular walkway. There is a teleport in one of the rooms near a sink that will only open once the Clear Sky base is destroyed. This will transport into a different part of the circlular walkway ending in another teleport point. However this teleport requires all 3 Artifacts to be held before opening. I am assuming this leads back to Zaton however as i have not found how to get the final artifact I have not been able to activate the last teleport.
==========================================================================================================
1) enter the CNPP by the entrence in the limansk tunnel by the bridge, follow the walkthrough that that russian does to save gunslinger however he does not have any artifact on him that is just left from the earlier version.


2) go through limansk, get quest to find scars PDA, escort Galetskiy but do not follow him, instead go back and use teleport in Deli to go back to Dark valley


3) Spawn or go to the Z team and ask the commander for the Greeks PDA


4) Possibly need to go through teleport behind Sidorovich if the game kills you when spawning in Red Forrest (always make a quicksave before teleporting or using a guide into the red forrest for thius reason otherwise its back to the last manual/quicksave). Complete any of the clan quests etc, when you give gunslinger the Greeks PDA you will get removed from the clan you chose at the very begiining of the game.


5) Kill the monolith that spawn again


6) give greeks PDA to gunsligher and watch cinimatic


7) after cinematic meet first stalker again and then teleport to Limansk


8) Use Teleport in Deli to get back to Dark Valley


9) Carry on with escorting Galetskiy, Anelia getting 2nd artifact, getting artifact in Dark Valley corridor etc basicaly do everything that is to do before joining monolith


10) when you have done everything, go to CNPP, then Limansk, escort lostman to construction site, Join Monolith, Teleport to Dark Valley by using Deli teleport. From Dark Valley go to Garbage then Flea Market and use teleport to Swamps.


11) wipe out Clear Sky Base except mechanic, barman, shopkeeper, the one looking at the tv and kill all the mutants, then use teleport in tree to go back to Flea Market then from Garbage to Army Wharehouses, Red Forrest, CNPP, Limansk.


12) Construction Site, Jupitor Underground Note as you are monolith Zombified stalkers are neutral


13) Speak to First Stalker again to the right of the spawn point. Go through Jupiter Underground until reaching the long shaft up to Limansk where there is a scientist at the top who will tell you how to get the 3rd artifact.


14) go back into the main hall and shoot down the helecoptor that spawns in the roof gap. Make the way up to the top teleports and then into Zotan.
