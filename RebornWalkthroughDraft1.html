<p>=====================</p>
<p>Before you begin the game, I highly advise reading Hints section of the README_REBORN_253_ENG.txt file in the Reborn Team folder. My Windows 7 installation put the folder on my desktop. Here are a few hints of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>This game crashes a lot! Save often, especially after you score an important find or complete a difficult task. For me, a crash usually happens with the Inventory open for more than a few seconds or when transition pointing.</li>
<li>I play this at either Stalker or Veteran level. If you play at Novice, you may find it easier to kill some mutants, encounter fewer Undefeatable Zombies, and fewer enemies in general.</li>
<li>The dialogs are, at times, mind-numbingly long in comparison to the original game. To make matters worse, the writing style is either an abysmal attempt at vernacular or we&#39;re suppose to think all these characters flunked the second grade. Many of these conversations seem to have no bearing on the game. At this point in the game, they seem to be distractions from the main objectives.</li>
<li>Most zombies can be taken out with a single shot gun to the head (pump, not that semi-auto piece of junk). Just don&#39;t let them get too close. When there is a group of them, an RPG works in most cases. The flamethrower works, too. But I like to save that for the spiders.</li>
<li>The best weapon I&#39;ve found for taking out Controllers, Burers (a.k.a. lawn gnomes), and Undefeatable Zombies (usually wearing Exoskeleton suit) is the Barrett M82A1 (.50 cal). Again, head shot = one shot. You can also do it with about five or six rounds from the Dragunov, or several rounds from a Vintar.</li>
<li>Mutant spiders can&#39;t climb very high. My favorite tactic is to get up on a vehicle or boulder and give them each about five shot gun blasts, a couple of VOG-25 grenades, or a blast from the flamethrower.</li>
<li>Bloodsuckers cannot be killed while invisible. At least, I haven&#39;t figured out a way to do it yet. However, they show themselves just before they strike. So, if you&#39;re up for a game of chicken, load up the shot gun and stand your ground. You may also want to save before and after the encounter.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve added links to various pages of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Clear_Sky" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Wiki: Clear Sky</a> to provide more information. I&#39;ve written quite a bit on the stashes, locations, and helped on some other pages.</li>
<li>Check every corpse, you never know what you might find.</li>
</ul>
<div>User note: I thought about putting "Back to the top" links in periodically because this walkthrough is so long. Instead, I&#39;d like to offer this tip. You can do the same thing with most browsers by holding the Ctrl key down and clicking the top of the side scroll bar (just below the arrow).</div>
<h3>The Walkthrough</h3>
<p>==============</p>
<p>As you can tell by the empty entries in the preceding lists, this is a work in progress. There is still a lot of back and forth between maps (sorry) which I hope to reduce once I complete the game. If you have any suggestions, things that I&#39;ve missed, or questions, please send me a note: kwag_myers@att.net.
<h3 id="zarton">Zarton</h3>
<p>The game starts with you spawning at sunset in the northwest corner of the Zarton map from Call of Pripyat (COP) and you instantly get a message to run. If you don&#39;t, a mutant thorn bush makes you start the game all over, so best to run. Sprint southeast until you get to the Burnt Farmstead, and then check the map. This is also a good place to save, because if you get caught by the Psuedogiant you have to start all over again with a new game. You want to head straight for the Skadovsk, which is marked on your map.</p>
<p>Once at the Skadovsk you will notice that you can&#39;t stand on the mess decking. This is important to know because it can work for you or against you, depending on where you are. This also is true for wire fences. Go inside, up the stairs and turn left to get the “swag”. You might as well put your weapons away because they are useless on this map.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the map, you may find a few corpses (with nothing on them) and the south end of the Preobrazhensky Bridge is surrounded by a teleport that takes you back to the complex on the north end of the bridge where there's spiders and zombies. One video I watched shows an artifact at the south end of the bridge, but I haven't figured out how to get there without teleporting back to the north end. The player who made the video had 21 PDAs in their inventory, so maybe we'll come back to this later?</p>
<p>The PDA shows only one transition point in the Testing Workshop of the Iron Forest (a.k.a. the Stingray 2 crash site) in the southwest corner of the map. The problem is, the place is infested with mutants. You don&#39;t have enough ammo to kill them all, so a little game of Catch Me If You Can is your best option: 
<ul><li>One tactic I found online is to show yourself to the mutants, then run to the Oakpine anomaly to the northeast. Climb up and wait for all the mutants to get there. You don't need to go to the top, but just so you're over the gully to cause the mutants to go below you. I like to use the southwest leg of the anomaly as it's the shortest distance and easy to walk up. Once the first Psuedogiant is almost below you, sprint back to the Testing Workshop. Don't wait too long because the Psuedogiants will stomp and you won't be able to sprint for a few seconds, which is all the spiders need to catch you.</li>
<li>Another tactic, which seems easier if you do it right, is to enter the area from the east. Walk toward the mutants until you hear them react, then run back to an opening in the wall as far south (right) as you can. Then head south around the shipping crates and to the southeast corner of where the building extends. Wait for the mutants to be sure they don't lose your trail (otherwise you have to start all over again). When the first mutant gets close, walk through the fence and wait for the rest of them to join up. Again, the Psuedogiants are the slowest and once the first one gets there, sprint east before it stomps. Go west until you can get between the buildings and then head north to the end of the wall that runs along the west side of the Iron Forest. When you get to the end of the wall, carefully maneuver around the wall and sprint to the Testing Workshop.</li></p>
<div>Note: This next part is complicated and you may be able to pause the game when you reach the bottom of the second set of stairs if you need to reference this section again.</div>
<p>As soon as you enter the door, turn left and go down the steps one level, then left through the doorway and follow the hall to the right. If you encounter a blind dog along the way, just keep running. If you're playing at the Master level, you may also have a black spider in your way. They usually take four to five shot gun blasts and you only have two in the chamber. You'll be dead before you can reload, so try to jump over it.</p>
<p>At the end of the hall, there's a quick right than left down two more sets of stairs at a right angle and continue down a longer hall (don't go all the way down the stairs, but just to the first doorway). At the end and to the left are four more sets of stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, go through the door on the right, and then left into the large room where the pseudogiant was in Call Of Pripyat. Mounted to the wall on the left is a ladder you can climb to the top. Now you&#39;re safe from the mutants and may want to quick save in case you fall transitioning to the cat walk. If you're bleeding and loosing health, take a vodka or two.</p>
<div>Condensed version: Left stairs, left door, right hall, right/left stairs, left stairs, right, left, ladder.</div>
<p>In Call Of Pripyat, there was an opening in the duct work in the southwest corner of the room opposite where you entered that led to the area where you found the papers for the Gauss rifle. This is where the transition point is located. Make your way over there using the overhead crane. In fact, you can stay on the cat walk of the crane to transition point without actually jumping down into the duct.</p>
<h3 id="yantar">Yantar</h3>
<div>At this point in the game, the map on your PDA has some added reference points. Some differ from the original Clear Sky and I will try to use this game's version to (hopefully) avoid confusion.</div>
<p>You transport to the Mobile Lab compound in Yantar and the screen displays a thought. This is your cue to make your way to the Clear Sky camp in the Swamp to get answers from Dr. Bashnya. There are two transition points to Agroprom, one to the south and another to the east (which is guarded by a group of zombies). It doesn&#39;t matter which one you take, but I recommend taking on the zombies so you can start collecting weapons. Be aware that these guys are packin&#39;. But they're not too quick and you can run past them before they react. Then you'll have more cover, and if you're lucky, the zombie with the RPG will do your work for you. If not, you should have just enough shot gun ammo to take them out with head shots. Collect as much gear as you can, and notice that you can carry a whole lot more that your limit. Once you&#39;re done with the zombies, you may be tempted to go hunting zombies for more loot. But there's plenty where we're going, so I recommend you head for the transition point.</p>
<h3 id="agroprom">Agroprom</h3>
<p>If you used the southeast transition point, there are corpses on top of the hill with more loot in front of you. Walk between or around the two trees, up the slope and climb on top of the rocks to avoid the mutants. Also, avoid contact with Duty even though they show as neutral on your PDA. They turn on you without warning. There are some zombies to the west if you want more swag. Also, if you happen to gain stash coordinates, you can them for now and collecting them later in the game. Especially if the stash is near a Duty post.</p>
<div>My strategy with collecting gear is to have something for every ammo type (except pistols, I only need one of those). If I get to a point where I have to decide between what to keep and what to drop, I always keep the most valued item. When I get to the Cordon I can trade these, get my gear fixed and upgraded. It&#39;s always good to have about six figures in your account. You&#39;ll have a chance to really build up your account once you get to the swamp. Head east to transport to the Garbage. Again, there's plenty of zombies to build up your inventory. At this point (without artifacts) you can carry 200 kilograms.</div>
<p id="sheluden">From the plateau, head southeast to the Barracades by a train car. In the tower is a dead banit named Sheluden with the first PDA. Sheluden's PDA has some valuable information on flash drives and another PDA in the Underground, which we will get to later. Many of these flash drives tell about hidden transitions.</p>
<h3 id="garbage">Garbage</h3>
<p>Head for the transition point near the Receiving Outpost at the south end of the road. As you approach you'll hear a fire fight, which usually ends with an RPG blast. A squad of Russian Special Forces (RSF) is attacking some bandits. You can either way for the attackers to finish up and head toward the Gravel Pit, or try to take them out with an RPG as they leave. Either way, there's probably more loot than you can carry at this point.</p>
<p>Be sure to save before you move on and check your PDA, because you never know who or what is going to be waiting for you when you spawn at the Far Outpost. I've been greeted by mutants and RSF. I was able to fight my way past the RSF, but the mutants forced me to go back through the Garbage, Dark Valley, and then to the Cordon. The object is to get to the Old Farmstead to trade off unwanted weapons and get some repairs, even some upgrades to the shot gun.</p>
<h3 id="cordonNorth">Cordon North</h3>
<p>As you head south toward the Northern Farmstead in the Cordon there are mutants, a Controller, and two Burers on the right near the Bivouac in the Meadow and zombies to the left at the Camp in Spruce Forest. If you go left you can walk through the fence to get past the zombies. I haven't figured out how to kill the pseudogiants yet, so I try to avoid them. You may notice two transition points to the west of Hideout Under Rocks. These are described <a href="#sultan">here</a>.</p>
<p id="fd1">More corpses near Camp in spruce forest, but you&#39;ll have to deal with the zombies first. However, these are not armed and not very agressive. So, you may be able out maneuver them. Get to the Northern Farmstead so you can trade in all your goodies and get your gear repaired.  You can take on optional missions, but there's no flash drives or PDAs in it for you. And unless you are really hard up for cash, these are a waste of ammo.</p>
<p id="fdswamp">Sheluden's PDA mentions a flash drive at the Quiet Hideout, which is east of the Old Farmstead. The corpse is guarded by some psuedodogs and at least one of them is a cloner. It's best to take them out from a distance before they start cloning. I should mention that clones can go through fences, too. The body of the RSF has a flamethrower and the Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Swamps.</p>
<p>From the Quiet Hideout, go west to the Bonfire in Forest, but not to the transition point. There's a helicopter that likes to shoot rockets at you when you're in the Village Center. From the Bonfire in Forest, go up the hill to the railroad tracks and follow them west until you can get a good shot with an RPG. If you're luck enough to hit it in the tail section, it will go down with one shot. Otherwise, you're going to need a second hit. Once that's out of the way, follow the western edge of the map heading south towards the transition point in the southwest part of the map. As you pass the Bonfire Under Tree, be sure to stay on the east side of the fence. There's a hidden teleport up on the hill that we don't want to use just yet.</p>
<p>Go straight to the transition point and do NOT stop at Sidorovich's. Go outside the fence when you get close to the tunnel so the military doesn't start shooting. Go into the tunnel and teleport to the Swamp.</p>
<h3 id="swamp">Swamp</h3>
<p>You spawn on the east side of the Southern Farmstead, which has a few Lone Wolfs you can either avoid, or take out. Then head for the Clear Sky camp. When you get south of the Fishing Village, walk through the fence and continue toward the camp. As you approach the gate, you&#39;ll be stopped by a rather length dialog, at which time you can choose how you want to play the rest of the game. My choice for this walkthrough is to join Clear Sky. Here are the objectives:
<ul><li>Find the Art-hunter and buy artifacts.</li>
<li>Find the way to Limansk.</li>
<li>Find all three Artifacts Of Death.</li>
<li>Collect 12 PDAs.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>I should also mention that I found playing the game with emissions on only slows the game down and offers no additional change your playing abilities, only to your patience. Also, Lebedev tells you about using Esc+F2, which brings up the Faction Commander control panel. Supposedly, it's a crucial part of the game. But I haven't figured out how it works to that end. Please feel free to enlighten me at kwag_myers@att.net.</p>
<div>Note: There are two teleports in Clear Sky's camp. One is closed off and I haven't figured out how to get to it, and the other is in the tree next to the technician's hut, that takes you to random places, such as southwest of the Pump Station, or to the top of the Flea Market. To use it, go up the stairs of the hut, turn right and go up the ramp to the roof of the building east of the hut. Then, jump to the front part of the hut's roof and sprint jump at the tree.</div>
<div id="fdswampabout">Note: I wasn't able to find a transition point in either the graves next to the old church or the graves just north of there. I looked at several locations for a small grave yard, but did not see one. However, the grave yard next to the church is the landing spot for the secret transition point behind the Duty base in the Agroprom. <a href="#agropromtele">More information here</a>.</div>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to cash in on all those weapons you collected from the bandits and get your reward. Also, make sure your gear is in good shape. Novicov is the only technician that can install night vision on Clear Sky suits, so get it fitted before you leave the Swamp. Be sure to talk to the guide at the south end of the camp, Lotsman. He gives you some information on transition points (which I haven&#39;t quite figured out how to use yet). He also agrees to meet you in Limansk.</p>
<p>Once you&#39;re ready to leave the camp, check your PDA for a red target west by northwest of the camp. This is Meatgrinder, and that&#39;s your next objective. After talking with him, head for the watchtower on the west edge of the map, where in the original Clear Sky, you were sent on your first mission. The guy in the tower tells you to run for the tower, then he climbs down and gets killed. Check the bodies because one of them has a really nice shot gun. You can hang around the Swamp, maybe take some jobs and build up your inventory of ammo and cash. You can by stashed from the trader and barkeep, but none of them have flash drives or PDAs.</p>
<p>One thing I highly recommend is to head for the northwestern part of the Swamp which is marked Detector "Veles" on your PDA map. Remember that Veles behind the mattress in the original Clear Sky? Well, if not, there&#39;s a cave between the box cars and bridge, and behind the mattress in the corner is a Veles detector. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Hidden_Veles_Detector" target="_blank">Hidden Veles Detector</a> if you need a walkthrough. And be sure to check the cave for an artifact before you leave. You may pick up a Gravi for your belt. Also, you're probably going to encounter another helicopter flying over the northern part of the Swamp.<p>
<p>I'm not sure about this next bit being necessary or optional, but it's fairly easy. Up in the northeast corner of the map, east of the Northern Farmstead, is a Person of Interest. This is Zarka, and she will ask you to escort her to her friends, which are northwest of the Encampment Under Embankment. Before you contact Zarka, you have to clear out the Northern Farmstead. When you do, be sure to watch for reenforcements coming in from the south west. If you look out the western facing window of the house you can see the bridge they use to get to the farm.</p>
<p>Take Zarka to her friends (who may not actually be there, but it doesn't matter). Be sure to keep her on the minimap or she&#39;ll go back to her starting point. She stops by the pond just west of the Northern Farmstead to check for anomalies, then goes west until the fence turns north toward the train wreck. She passes the train wreck on the north side and meets up with her buddies just a little further west. After the dialog, they head to Agroprom, but don&#39;t bother trying to follow them.</p>
<p>Be sure to collect as many artifacts as you can. Read the description of each one as some can be used as a secondary weapon. Put the artifact in place of a pistol or Bulldog 6 and hold the shoot key/button until you are ready to deploy. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Anomalies_and_Artifacts_in_Clear_Sky_%28Maps%29">Clear Sky Artifacts</a> for a map of anomalies.</p>
<p>When you're ready to move on, head for the transition point in the northeast corner of the map (where you met Zarka).</p>
<h3 id="cordonSouth">Cordon South</h3>
<div>Hidden transition points: There is an unmarked transition point directly west of the Bondfire under tree, which is south of the Rookie camp, and takes you to the north edge of Dark Valley.</div>
<p>You spawn in the Cordon just south of the Military Outpost. Walk on the east side of the fence until you get past the mine field. Go see 
Wolf in the Rookie village and take his job to escort a stalker named Anelia from the tunnel to the Dark Valley, which is marked Bonfire by Tunnel on you map. Anelia is trapped by three or four Bloodsuckers running around the camp. Then head for the Vehicle Station, where you have to take out the special forces there in order to complete the task. I've found it's easier at night because of their headlamps. On your way, make sure the Camp Near Van is clear of mutants. For some reason, Anelia holds up here if there's mutants present.</p>
<p>My tactic for dealing with the bloodsuckers is to stand in the road just west of the rail fence. This seems to be their boundary for some reason an you can step forward a few steps to bait them to come at you. Remember to wait until they show themselves just before striking and take your shot at the head. It took a few tries, and a quick-save after each kill, but I was able to take them out one by one. Oh, and you have to give Anelia a gun before she will leave. Like Zarka, you must keep Anelia on your minimap as you escort her to the Rookie Camp, or you'll have to start the mission all over again.</p>
<p id="joker">When you get back to the camp, Anelia tells you all about looking for her father and how her boyfriend came to the Zone to make some money for their wedding, but became a zombie instead. Let her tell her story because you get coordinates for a stash when she's done. In the stash is the Joker of Horror flash drive that tells you to look up Korsakov, who is in the Agroprom. But first, we need to collect some flash drives, PDAs, and artifacts, so back to the Garbage.</p>
<h3 id="garbage2">Garbage 2</h3>
<p id="forgotten">In the Garbage, you get a message when you spawn about a toolbox stash (with a PDA inside), which is marked on your map (Forgotten PDA). Note that Bandits are now enemies. Head for the gas anomaly north of the Gravel Pit to pick up your two artifacts and then to the stash. From the stash, go east along the base of the trash heap and follow it around until you get to the New Encampment. Turn to the east and look for a dead tree with a large trunk. On the southeast side of the trunk is a corpse with the PDA from Garbage, which tells you of 12 PDAs you need to collect. There are more corpses north of this, if you want to loot them. Then head for the Flea Market.</p>
<p id="unknown">At the Flea Market, those bandits are waiting for you in the cellar again. You can shoot them through the door, and retrieve the Forgotten PDA. If the Flea Market is under attack from the north, it&#39;s a good idea to help them out because the attackers are packing some really nice hardware and you may be able to increase your arsenal, or at least pick up some ammo. There's also a couple bandits waiting in the cellar of the Flea Market to ambush you again. Approach carefully because they shoot through the door and it's best to come around from the southwest and stand at the end of the wall so you can lean to the right to take them out. In the cellar is the PDA of the Unknown.</p>
<p>When you're finished collecting artifacts, head for the transition point east of the Flea Market to Dark Valley.</p>
<h3 id="darkvalley">Dark Valley</h3>
<p>Make your way northeast to Freedom's base if you need to get your equipment repaired. Starting from the northwest corner of the camp wall, go west to the fence and follow it north until, using your minimap, you are directly in line with the two corpses. Take out your detector and move in to grab the artifact, and loot the bodies if you want. Then, turn and go out the same way you came in. If you purchased any stashes from Ashot or the barkeeper and happened to get the Stalker's grave stash, there should be a nice little Goldfish artifact to increase your load capacity by 150 kg.</p>
<div>Hidden transition point: North of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Stalker's_grave" target="_blank">Stalker's grave</a> stash that goes to the Bonfire under tree in the Cordon at first. However, at some point during the game it switches to the factory in Yantar.</div> 
<p>If you need any help with the stashes, see <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Clear_Sky_Stashes_by_Location#Dark_Valley" target="_blank">Clear Sky Stashes by Location - Dark Valley</a> for walkthroughs.</p>
<p id="dvPDAs">Make your way to the gas station and get the PDA from the corpse on top of the tank, which is (Uncle Artikular friend's PDA). This is
where you went to get the flash drive off of Yar&#39;s friend in the original Clear Sky. If you need help getting the artifact from the top of the north tank, see the Note section for <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gas_Station" target="_blank">Gas Station</a>. This PDA mentions a teleport in a tube at the Mercenary's base, which is marked on your map as the Factory Lobby. But if you try it too soon, the teleport is disabled. While you're still on top of the tank, take a look down the road south toward the bus. There may be a Burer in that area that is an easy shot from where you are.</p>
<p id="valley">Next, head to the Encampment at Foothill, where you'll find the PDA los in Valley laying on a boulder behind the mattress.</p>
<p>The first optional mission offered is to capture the Island southwest of the Factory Lobby. The only way I've found to deal with a Psuedogiant is with a Soul artifact that creates a Gravi anomaly. However, if one of the Freedom guys gets caught in the anomaly you create with the artifact, they turn on you and you can't complete the mission. So, I'm not sure if there's any value in the optional missions in Dark Valley as it may be a waste of time.</p>
<p id="glykin">There is a Controller in the Camp amidst some rocks. Standing on top of the hill north of the camp, he can be taken out with the Dragunov because you are out of his range (at this point in the game, I don't always have a .50 cal). Then continue collecting artifacts until you get to the south end of the map. There's another PDA in the Encampment on Farm, Lingov's corpse (in the original Clear Sky) in the southwestern corner of the map, which is now Commandant Glykin's PDA.</p>
<p>The teleport behind the Factory lobby still doesn't work, so once you get all you can, head back to the Garbage and to the transition point north of the Northern Outpost. We need to find this Looter guy in the Mercenaries Bivouac.</p>
<h3 id="army">Army Warehouses</h3>
<p>Go north to a squad leader and ask for a job. He&#39;ll give you the Intelligent Service Commander&#39;s PDA task. Then check your map and find Looter and go talk to him in his...office. Looter tells you about hiring a former Clear Sky member who then shows on your map as an important person. You can buy some stashes from Looter, but none of them have any flash drives or PDAs.</p>
<p id="iscPDA">Before retrieving the PDA, there&#39;s a Controller northeast of the village that needs to be removed. I once encountered the Controller as I was walking straight from Looter to the PDA. He didn't see me and I was able to take him out before he did. I prefer to use the .50 cal on Controllers and Burers, but you can also use the Dragonov SVD, which takes a few shots, but it works. With the Controller down, switch to the shot gun and get up on the rocks on the west take out the mutants near the corpses. Try for the Chimeras first because they can jump and get you even on the tallest rock. I like to come at them from the west where there&#39;s a smaller rock I can jump up on and shoot between two larger ones. The Chimeras won&#39;t jump at you unless they can see you.</p>
<p id="ocaPDA">With the mutants out of the way, grab the PDA and read it. You may even want to take a screen shot of it, because you have to return it in order to complete the mission and you can&#39;t take another job without completing this one. Before you leave the area, be sure to scan for artifacts. According to the PDA, one of the guys with Looter is a former Clear Sky member and has a PDA with valuable information on it. This is Butcher, whom Looter told you about, and is the blue icon on the east edge of the village on your map. Go talk with him, cap him, and take his PDA. Here's why:</p>
<div>On one play through, I noticed his icon was gone and a corpse nearby. Sure enough, Butcher had bought it and he was carrying the O'consciousness Agent PDA. On another play through, I brought him an Artifact of Death, because he offered to tell me what to do with them, and he offered no help (maybe I need all three). Since the mission is to collect PDAs, I'm afraid Butcher has to take one for the team.</div>
<p>The rest of the jobs here are optional. However, the second job just might result in a Barrett M82A1 .50 cal if you don't already have one, or you need some ammo. Or, you can just go get it without doing the mission. Again, be sure to scan the area to the north for artifacts after you aquire the item. There's a possible bug with the mission "Return the Jellyfish", where I didn't get credit for returning the item, but when I left the map, I got a message that the mission had failed.</p>
<p>Looting corpses may get you the stash coordinates to the Cross near tree stash, which has some ammo for the Gravi gun. When you're ready to move on, head for the northwest transition point to the Red Forest. According to Looter, Luke's last known location was with Forester in the Red Forest. Before you jump, get either an RPG or .50 cal ready.</p>
<h3 id="redforest">Red Forest</h3>
<p>There may be a squad of zombies at the bend in the road up ahead who are about to attack Duty at the gate to the Limansk Reserve. If you have your RPG ready and get close enough, you can take out most of them with one shot. However, (depending on what level you're playing at) there's one Undefeatable Zombie that a .50 cal in the head before he goes down.</p>
<p>Another possibility is you&#39;ll hear a swarm of mutant spiders. In this case, sprint to the shipping containers on the west side of Forester&#39;s building and jump on top. You can use your shot gun to clear them out. I've also had them come out right after taking out the last zombie. It&#39;s usually at this point that I turn my speakers off. Go in, talk to Forester and have him repair any equipment that needs it.</p>
<p>Take caution when you leave the building as there may be any number of surprises waiting for you. So far, I&#39;ve encountered a Burer in Forester's building, on the cat walk, and across the road (attacking the survivors of the zombie firefight). Once, he came into the room while I was talking to Forester and killed me before I knew it, then attacked the old man. I've seen it come down the ladder on the east side of the building a few times. I've also encountered those spiders I mentioned before, and a Monolith soldier coming in north of the building (one time he was in the attic of the building to the east and easy pickings).</p>
<p id="521">Climb the ladder on the east side of the building and remember not to walk on the mess decking. At the top of the ladder, turn to the right where it&#39;s solid (you may have to jump) and go north to the stairs. At the top of the stairs, there's another ladder in front of you. To get to it, you either have to go left, the long way around the building, by walking on the narrow solid section of the decking, or jumping on the handrail and then to the solid deck area at the foot of the ladder. When you get to the top you&#39;ll get hit by an anomaly, but just keep going straight to the next ladder. At the top of this ladder, move to the left to align with the narrow solid section.</p>
<p>On the east side of the building, go past the cable and climb down into the area with boxes. There&#39;s a PDA in one of them, Fivetwentyone's PDA. Be careful of the anomaly on the other side (north) of the area. The boxes on that side are empty.</p>
<p>To get down, the quickest way is to go back to the ladder, climb down at least one of the two ladders and then purposely fall through the decking to the roof. You can go through the decking from where you are, but you&#39;re going to need a vodka to stop the bleeding. Go to the northeast corner of the lowest roof. There&#39;s some sort of tank you can land on, and then to the ground.</p>
<p>Also, you can go back the way you came, or jump on the handrail, then to the cable going to the other building and slow-walk down. Move to the lowest part of the roof and walk off (don&#39;t jump or you&#39;ll start bleeding).</p>
<p id="lost">The PDA that Forester told you about is now marked on your map directly south of the north gate to the forest. However, at Veteran 
level, it is nearly impossible to save Azot. I have successfully saved him and the job he gives me is to return the tank machine gun, which I can get from any squad leader in the Red Forest. When I return with the machine gun, he doesn't give me another task. Instead, I do some side jobs for Duty. Go and ask one of the squad leaders for a job. He'll send you to the tank to retrieve the machine gun. Make sure your inventory can handle another 50 kg or you won't be able to carry the gun back and head southeast to the tunnel that leads to the Devilish Encampment, which is marked Mutant's Den on your map. If you're scanning for artifacts, there's three along the west embankment that will be easier to collect on your second trip. The best weapon to have out for your first time through the woods is the flamethrower you picked up on your first trip through the Cordon. There's spiders and zombies to the east which attact right after you hear the bloodsucker roar.</p>
<div>If this is the first time you've brought out the flamethrower, you may notice some still pictures of a stalker scaling a wall. This is explained in the <a href="#lukes">Last record in the Luke's brocken PDA</a> when we get to it.</div>
<p>There's another group of spiders and a Controller waiting in the tunnel where, in the original Clear Sky, you led a group of Stalkers to the Devilish camp. This is now marked Mutant's Den on your PDA map. The trick is to get as close to the tunnel as possible and attract the spiders&#39; attention (toss a smoke grenade or something). Then, sprint to the southeast gate (as a reference, there's a transition point just beyond where you need to get to), jump to the bottom of the windshield opening, and climb on top of the truck cab. Make sure you get all the spiders before the Controller shows up. You can hide behind the cab so the Controller can&#39;t get you and lean out with your .50 cal to clear the way. This is a good place to save, because the Controller doesn't always follow the spiders and then you have to go looking for him. The easiest way I've found in the case is to go to the tunnel and jump into the second trolley car, shot gun one or two of the rodents, then switch to the .50 cal, turn around to face where you came in and get ready for the Controller to show himself. Another option is the pile of boulders along the path to the east of the tunnel, about halfway between Dark Yar and Misty Meadow.</p>
<p>With the way clear, go through the tunnel and head north to the tank. There&#39;s a group of spiders there which can climb onto the tank, along with some zombies. However, the rocks to the southeast of the tank make for a great place to shoot them from. The transition point over the tank doesn&#39;t work (which Forester has already warned you about), but the corpses have some ammo and maybe a mini-gun if you don&#39;t already have one. However, you're going to be coming right back here, so if you're near the weight limit in your inventory, wait to loot the corpse on the next trip. When you&#39;re done there, go back to the tunnel and don&#39;t be surprised if you see a couple soldiers on your map. They don&#39;t have any weapons and will run away from you when you get close. There may also be a zombie and one or two spiders in the tunnel, so watch for a red dot on your HUD.</p>
<p id="returned">As you make your way back through the forest, you'll probably encounter more zombies and spiders. There are a few boulders that are low enough to jump on to, but high enough to keep you safe. These zombies, however, don't go down easily and I've found using the machine gun from the tank is the best way to deal with them. Take the machine gun back to the squad leader, then ask the other squad leader for a job and he'll send you back to the tank to fetch a PDA. Make sure you read the PDA, or take a screen shot (because you have to give it back to complete the mission). This is the PDA of returned from Limansk.</p>
<p id="lost">Now you can go get the PDA that Forester told you about, the PDA of Lost in Red Forest. Next, get your .50 cal ready but not out (so you can sprint) and head for the bridge. As you approach, there's a cut scene fly over of the bridge. When it's done, save, sprint to the bridge and look for the Burer on the other side. Take it out as quick as possible then switch to the mini-gun and find something to jump up on, like the mini-bus near the gate house. Help Clear Sky cross the bridge. Once you're finished with the spiders, take out the Controller and the bridge will be safe to cross. There's some first aid kits in the lockers on the first floor of the gate house, then, if you want to load up on ammo, head for the other side. Strangely, you can walk on this grading without falling through.</p>
<p>The truck in the middle of the river has a Gravi Gun in the box behind the cab. To get to it, start from the east side of the bridge and walk out to the end of the broken cement and align yourself with the truck and a broken off pillar in between. Take a standing jump to the pillar, then to the truck. The gun is behind the cab and you can go back to the eastern side the same way, except don't try for the bridge from the pillar. Instead, jump to the right of the broken off piece and land on the shore. 









When you're ready, head back through the forest toward the northern transition point. Be sure to stop by and see Forester to get your gear fixed up.</p>
<div>The PDA of Lost in Red Forest and O'consciousness Agent PDA both tell us to save Azot, but at this point in the game I've only found his corpse on the west side of the bridge. I've tried going to the bridge right away, even before talking to Forester, with the same results. The quest for the PDA, however, will come from another.</div>
<p>As you walk toward the northern transition point, you have to walk past a semi truck and trailer in the road. Instead, jump up on the front bumper, then to the cab and onto the top of the trailer. A pseudodog (sometimes two) spawns at the curve in the road, with a Chimeras right behind it. You can take them out from where you are rather safely. Take care getting down (I go back the way I came) so you don't start bleeding. Once you get to the curve in the road, sprint until the transition point confirmation dialog shows. There's several more pseudodogs that spawn and it's easier just to run past them.</p>
<p>When you spawn in the Dark Valley overpass, you are facing north with an enlarged area ahead. Go down the planks and smash the wooden box on the right to get some more Gravi gun ammo, then continue north be transported back to the bridge in the Red Forest. Go down stairs and have the guide take you to the Village Center of the Cordon.</p>
<p>And now we can go see Sidorovich. This will cost you 4000 RU and about 10 minutes of your life you&#39;ll never get back. But you only get one shot at this, i.e., you can't go back later for a second visit. At one point, there&#39;s a cut scene dialog in, what I assume to be, Russian. Neither that nor the English dialog offer any help as near as I can tell. However, I got a tip from stalker Jesse Roy about the portal in Sidorovich's back room (that I couldn't figure out how to get to). Jump up on the ledge in front of Sidorovich, low-crouch and walk through the opening. As you approach the doorway to the next room you are transported to the Chernobyl NPP.</p>
<h3 id="cnpp">Chernobyl NPP</h3>
<p>After the cut scene, you are in a tunnel with a transition point at the end and a timer in the lower-left of your screen (if you take too long you'll fail the mission). Walk up to about half way and start looking through the scope of your Guass, Barrett, or Dragunov to the left. There's snipers on the roofs and stairs in the distance, mostly using Dragunovs (you can get their ammo later, so don't worry if you're getting low). You want to take as many of them out as you can to make this next part a little easier. When you get to the section of the tunnel where you can just see the stairs by leaning right, you're very close to the teleport. Then change to a grenade launcher, go through the teleport, sprint forward until you get to the metal plate and crouch down on the left side of the roof vent (to avoid any remaining snipers).</p>
<p>This looks familiar, only these guys are packing SVUmk-2's and .50 cal's, both of which can take you out with one shot. There's three Special Forces at the other end of the roof. Once you take these guys out, check the stairs, which is now ahead and to the right (southwest), for any snipers you may have missed.</p>
<p>Just as in the original Clear Sky, as you advance toward the next teleport, two more Special Forces spawn when you approach the step in the roof, sometimes at either end. Finally, three more as you reach the last row of roof vents before the transition point. I recommend hiding behind a steal plate and quick saving after you take out the first and second wave. Then, you can either sprint to the transition point or try for the third wave and collect some .50 cal ammo. Again, take too long and you'll fail the mission.</p>
<p>Next you land on a walkway with a transition point at the end. Another sniper spawns behind you as you pass the curved duct on the right. The next teleport takes you to the roof of the building with the teleport at the opposite corner and three waves of Monolith spawn, some wearing ghost suits. After you fight off the first wave, you have two options:<ul>
<li>Collect some ammo and go - If you stay near the north and west edges of the roof, you can loot corpses without triggering the next wave.</li>
<li>Get as much ammo as you can - Once again, take too long and you fail the mission. After collecting as much as you can without triggering the next wave, move to the structures in the middle of the roof with ribs on the sides for cover. Then, for the third wave, sprint to the south end of the roof to the same type of structure.
</ul>
When you're ready, go to the northern rail where the teleport displays on your minimap. Looking down, you can see a platform with the teleport at its northern end. You can either jump into the teleport, or move to the southern end of the platform and find the hidden ladder to climb down. The teleport takes you to the Agroprom Underground where you encountered a Controller before you could reach the valve to flood the lower level in the original Clear Sky. Now there's Pyrogeists, Bloodsuckers, and Zombies, in addition to some serious psy emission columns. There's an unmaked transition point on the other side of the room just before you get to the gated door that takes you to the Agroprom Research Institute. You have to use the curved outer walkways because you'll fall through the straight ones. I like to take the one on the right about a quarter way around and grab the Gravi gun ammo, then double back to avoid the Bloodsucker and go to the next circle. You want to get to the gate as quickly as you can.</p>
<h3 id="agroprom2">Agroprom 2</h3>
<p>You spawn on top of the west elevator shaft of the Agroprom Research Institute, which is under attack by zombies. For some reason, you can't climb down the ladder to the next level of the roof and have to jump. Plus, the inside stairways are both blocked off. But you can use the ladder on the south side of the building over by the east elevator shaft. There is a group of zombies coming out of a building north of the trading post entrance. They seem impervious to everything but a shot gun or mini-gun. Even RPGs are useless against them, and I'm usually out of fuel for the flamethrower by this point. After taking out the group, there's another one coming up the road that runs along the west of the base. When you have finished with the zombies outside the main building, the front door opens to reveal another group blocking your way.</p>
<p>Once all these zombies are gone, you can trade with Lentyay (the trader) and buy some stashes. Although, I have had it happen where the trader and technician don't return right away, or even until I leave the map and return. General Matov has a stash for sale, too. And then you can ask a squad leader for a job. In Agroprom, you must take these jobs in order to get Mohnat's PDA, which is the third task:
<ol><li>First task - Return the Spetsnas suit. The suit is in a foot locker inside the Agroprom Factory. On your way, stop by the Outpost by the hole to meet the Art-hunter. There's two artifacts in the factory's east building, top floor. The trader at the factory is Beard (a long way from the Skadovsk), who has a stash for sale. Also, Wanderer is in Hermit's hole and will offer you a job getting a PDA from the log cabin in the swamp. It's an easy job with one bandit that you can take out with a sniper rifle through the doorway from a safe distance. If you're lucky, There's an artifact in the symbiont anomaly southwest of the cabin and another one in the water to the north.
<p id="loghouse">Once you have the PDA (PDA from loghouse on the swamp, Agroprom) read it and then take it back to Wanderer. Sometimes he takes it from you and sometimes he doesn't. So be sure to at least read it, or take a screen shot. Next, you need to talk to Vivisector, who is near the northwest transition point to Yantar. Stay up along the east ridge of the valley to avoid being transition pointed to Yantar. If you get the dialog to teleport, click No and you'll have to climb up either side of the valley to try and get around the teleport again. Vivisector is at the very edge of the map. He, too, has a couple of stashes to sell, and informs you of how to get into the Underground. Now take the Spetsnas suit back and collect your reward.</p></li>
<li id="fdyantar">Second task - Return the VEPR, which is in the Underground. If I make it back to the Agroprom and the guy is still alive, I have to give it to him. In the mean time, I plan on using it.
<p>The minimap points you to the Underground Entrance on top of the hill northeast of the Agroprom Institute. When you spawn inside the chamber, remember that you can't walk on the grading, but you can walk on the rails. Once you get to the ground floor, go through the doorway and follow the hall to the left. Put your gun away because there's an anomaly that may cause you to drop it part way through. The easiest way is to go around the barrel on the left and stay against the left wall until you can line yourself up with the space right of the pillar and sprint for it. Just before you get there you loose your bearings, so just stop until you can see your way again. Advance to where the hall narrows again and take out your RPG. Go up to the doorway, staying against the right wall until you're there, then side-step left and let the zombies have it, get back out of the doorway, and switch to the shot gun.</p>
<p>As you go through the doorway, stay to the left. The doorway on the right has another anomaly, so you may want to put your gun away before going through. But first, check the room for another zombie. If you don't see him, or he hasn't come after you, he's probably in the corner on the right. Go through the doorway, take out your gun and let him have it. Then switch to the .50 cal. There's one undefeatable zombie through the next door, and a regular zombie behind him. If you take too long with them you might have to deal with a pseudogiant. Then up the ladder to Strelok's stash, take out the flamethrower (even if you don't have any fuel), and save your game.</p>
<p>When you get close to the door on the right side of the room, you teleport into a room with Luke lying on the floor and a timer starts. According to the O'consciousness Agent PDA, you have to climb the ladder in the circular room to turn off the timer. If you bought stashes, you may see two of them along the way, but don't take the time to get stashes now. We'll be back later to get all that. Also, don't talk to Luke (unless you click through the conversation quickly so that it's in your PDA Messages). You have to go up the ladder, through the door and turn the valve on the left. Then, cook the two zombies while you wait for the door to open and sprint to the other end of the room, down the steps and turn left down the hallway like in Shadow of Chernobyl. Stay to the left side and use the flamethrower to get past the giant rodents, go up the ladder and wait for the rodents to leave. Save again, climb down and grab the VEPR, then turn around and walk through the gate. Stay along the wall to avoid any remaining rodents and when you come to the end of the hallway you are transported to the overpass in Dark Valley.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dv2">Dark Valley 2</h3>
<p>No matter which direction you take, you transition point to another map, and we don't want to leave just yet. There's someone we need to talk to at the north end of the overpass. There's a wooden box nearby where the floor drops down and it has the <a href="#yantarteles">Flash drive with data on hidden transition point on the Yantar</a>. Then move forward and when the dialog comes up about transporting, click No and get tossed out of the overpass.</p>
<p>Start inside the base at the southeast corner of the incomplete building. Follow the complex wall south until you reach a wall panel leaning against another panel. There's just enough room for you to crouch down and get between the panels into the unused part of the complex, then go around and in the building on the left to talk to First Stalker. He tells you there are four flash drives in the overpass with information on hidden transition points and a not-so-helpful strategy on how to get them. When you're done talking with First Stalker, go up to the top of the ladder to the overpass, turn and jump onto the ledge above First Stalker. There's a case of ammo for a gravi gun at the far end.</p>
<p id="fdcordon">Now you can check teleport in the drain pipe at the Abandoned Factory. This takes you to the north end of the overpass and the Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Cordon. The radiation is pretty high here, so don't take time to read it. If you move either north or south you teleport to the Bonfire under tree. Instead, click No again and head back to the Army Warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="army2">Army Warehouses 2</h3>
<p>Go to the transition point in the northeast corner of the map near the Hideout in dry woods. This is a tricky one because if you don't follow this path you get hit with a fatal psy emission. First, if you haven't been here already, you'll need to clear out the mutants. The bull dozer is a good vantage point for this. Next, locate the Stop sign laying in the road along the line of stakes with skulls. Turn left and go up to the rock face, then right and stay along the rock face until you get to the large boulder on the right. Turn to the right facing the road and align yourself to go between the two trees and over the small boulder next to the road, then sprint for the little boulder.</p>
<p>This transition point takes you back to another spot in the overpass of Dark Valley. The box behind you has the next flash drive, Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Agroprom.</p>
<p>Once you have the flash drive, move either direction and click No in the teleport dialog. Then make your way back to the Red Forest by way of the End Outpost transition points of the Dark Valley, Northern Outpost of the Garbage, and the Far Fortification Point of the Army Warehouses. When you spawn in the Red Forest, turn around and head back to the transition point. You can either try to out run the mutants again, or jump up on the semi and eliminate them before moving on. This time when you spawn in the Dark Valley overpass, turn south. This teleport was disabled the first time we came here, but now is working.</p>
<p id="desire">You are transported to the secret room of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">Gastronom</a> in Limansk. There, you find the Black artifact of a Desire, a flamethrower and fuel, the Exoskeleton suit mentioned in Luke's friend's PDA, and ammo for the gravi gun. When you move around the room a transition point dialog displays. However, I found that unless I am directly in front of the control panel, the game crashes. If it doesn't, you spawn in the hospital with a message that the enemy can't see you (as long as you don't walk in front of the machine gun). Instead make your way south on the second floor until you are behind the barrier with the machine gun. There's someone we need to talk to around the corner, the Unnamed Scientist. Then, go through the transition point and end up back at the Vehicle Station in the Cordon.</p>
<p>Now back to the CNPP by way of Sidorovich's back room. This time, you may need to sprint from one teleport to another. I found that if I took too long the game would crash. You can still pick up dropped weapons, but if you stop to loot corpses, the game may crash. When you get to the roof where you had to fight the Monolith, then jumped over the rail, instead, go to the teleport in the southeast corner of the roof. This puts you on the overpass that extends to the east of the building you teleported from. Gunslinger is there, and probably one or two Monolith trying to stop him. The Unnamed Scientist told us to push Gunslinger off the overpass, but I found that if I left him alone, he ended up on the ground by himself.</p> 
<p>Instead, (and this part is optional) I found that at this point I could take the time to loot corpses, so I took the overpass east, then south and up the ladder. There's a Pyrogeist about halfway up the stairs directly across the roof which can be taken out with a minigun. You should have plenty of ammo if you've been picking up machine guns along the way. Then go over to one of the structures near the landing of the stairs, jump up to the ledge of one of the ribs on the sides, then to the top. Sprint and jump to the landing and quickly jump again to get over the rail (before you fall off the ledge). Once you've collected all you want from the snipers you took out the first time you where here, go west to where the first three snipers where. If you look north on the ground, you may see Gunslinger under the overpass. You may also see some Clear Sky fighting with Monolith. You can use some of those sniper rounds you just picked up to help them out.</p>
<p>When you're ready to leave, take the teleport next to the overpass where it forks. This takes you into the tunnel at the south end of Limansk.
<h3 id="limansk">Limansk</h3>
<p>Make your way over the rubble at the end and drop down into the next part. When the dialog displays, click No. In fact, during one play through I had to click No multiple times before I got past the van and into the southern edge of Limansk. There's a Bandit in the same spot as the two Bandits were in the original Clear Sky, one in need of a med kit. There's another unarmed Bandit wondering around that doesn't attack, but I popped him anyway. Follow the same path as you did in the original Clear Sky, avoiding the Bandit ambush, and clear out the house as you did before. Don't forget the stash of VOG-25 grenades upstairs. Also, there's a Poltergeist that may come down the street. Use the machine gun nest and a mini-gun to make it go away, permanately.</p>
<p id="fdgarbage">Be sure to check the corpse(s) in and around the house to find the Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Garbage. Approach the courtyard carefully. There may be another Poltergeist, two Burers (unless you took them out before if you used the <a href="yantarteles">Yantar transition point</a>), and an assortment of mutants waiting for you. Find a place where you can snipe the Burers with your .50 cal, like the top of the light blue and white bus. Then switch back to your favorite mutant eliminator.</p>
<p>Before you start looting all those corpses, there's three machine gunners on a balcony to the north of the courtyard that are waiting for you to get in range, which is about the south wall of the deli on your right (looking north). Once they are down, you can move about the courtyard freely. However, if you're playing at a higher level, you may get a visit from a Monolith patrol coming from the north. If you go into the basement of the deli (on the south side of the building) you'll find Galetskiy. But don't talk to him just yet. He'll have to wait for our next trip to Limansk.</p>
<p id="fdCNPP">On the north side of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">Gastronom</a> building, which is across the courtyard from the deli, is a doorway with two doors. The one on the left leads to the basement, where there's some Gravi gun ammo and a teleport. This takes you back to the Dark Valley overpass where you'll find the fourth flash drive, Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the CNPP. Go north to teleport out of the overpass to the Camp at bottom of ravine. If you go south, well, it doesn't end well. From the ravine, head east to the road, then north for the hidden transition point north of the base. When you see the cross next to a tree, go between the two (with the cross on the right) and keep going until you teleport to the factory in Yantar.</p>
<h3 id="yantar2">Yantar 2</h3>
<p>You spawn near the transition point to the Red Forest and need to get past the zombies and spiders to the Uprooted tree. As you make your way, don't for get the two artifacts near the Factory Entrance.</p>
<p id="lukesfriend">The group of corpses are in the same place as in the original Clear Sky, northwest corner of the map near the Symbiont anomaly. There's a Burer, mutants, and zombies waiting for you, too. My strategy is to take out the Burer with the .50 cal, then switch to the RPG and fire a couple rounds at the mutants. Then, switch to the shot gun and head down the hill where there's no tall brush so you can see the rodents that come at you. Once the mutants are out of the way, go back up the hill and finish off any remaining zombies with a sniper rifle. Once the area is clear, get the artifact from the anomaly and the PDA of Luke's friend.</p>
<p>As you make your way to talk to Professor Sakharov, approach the swamp with care. A group of armed zombies guard the island in the swamp where one transition point is located. RPG = problem solved. And now you can grab the anomaly in the swamp. The Scientists Camp is usually under attack, indicated by the sirens. You have to clear the complex before you can talk with Sakharov. Also, he's going to want the PDA you just got, so take a read/screen shot before you talk with him. I haven't seen a need for the transition points in Yantar yet, but here's some information on them.</p>
<div><h3 id="yantarteles">Yantar transition points</h3>
<p>The transition point is next to the tree the zombies were standing near. When you spawn in Limansk, you're inside the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">deli overlooking the courtyard</a>, looking north. As you move forward you get a message from Lotsman that disappears before you can read it, with instructions on how to get to his location. Then you get another message about a doctor at the construction site. There are three transition points in the room you're in. There's a hidden one to the right that sends you back to Yantar with no dialog to opt out of being transported. The other two take you to the CNPP. I haven't figured out what to do to get out of the deli in order to follow Lotsman's instructions.</p>
<p>The other transition point is northeast of the swamp at the southeastern corner of the factory complex. There's a couple of zombies you have to take care of, then find the green crate (steamer trunk) next to the shed directly south of the transition point. Jump up on the crate, then the roof of the shed and over the wall. The transition point takes you back to the Clear Sky base in the Swamp.</p></div>
<p>When you're done with Sakharov, head back to either transition point for the Agroprom. Return the VEPR and find a Stalker squad leader (probably in the Institute Building B) to give you the third task, Return Mohnat's PDA.</p>
<h3 id="agroprom3">Agroprom 3</h3>
<div id="agropromtele">If you find yourself in the Agroprom and need to get to the Swamp, head for the transition point south of the Duty Base/Agroprom Research Institute. You spawn in the grave yard north of the old church, the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Grave_with_gas_mask" target="_blank">Grave with Gas Mask</a>.</div>
<p id="ocPDA">The Joker of Horror flash drive mentions the shooting range at the Agroprom, and that's where Korsakov is. One note about the shooting range: it isn't lit, and you have to surrender your gear so you don't have a head lamp or night vision. So, be sure to do this in the day light. I took the Scoring Challenge and afterward, started going through the dialog with Korsakov. I also discovered I now had the O'consciousness PDA. After a few questions, I had the option to asking about stashes and he sold me Joker's Stash, which is the location of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Under_cross" target="_blank">Under cross</a> stash in the original in the northeast corner of the map. The stash contain five Scientific Med kits, a Bubble artifact, three Anti-rad kits, and a sweet little Svarog detector prototype.</p>
<p id="mohnat">Now head to the Underground entrance and make your way to Strelok's stash, but don't go up yet. Mohnat's PDA is at the end of the hall, but you have to get past the Psuedogiant. For this, I recommend a Wrenched artifact to set up a small gravi anomaly. The Wrenched has a small radius of 7, but is powerful enough to take out the Psuedogiant. If you haven't used an artifact as a weapon yet, put it in place of your secondary weapon and hold down the fire button until the artifact leaves your hands. Then, get away from it and try to get the Psuedogiant to walk through the anomaly once it's going good (it takes a few seconds to get cranked up). You can sprint past the anomaly, but the Psuedogiant can't. Once he becomes red confetti, go to the end of the hall and down the stairs. The PDA is in a backpack under the stairs. If you need help finding it, see <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Backpack_under_stairs" target="_blank">Backpack under stairs</a>.</p>
<p id="lukes">Now back to Strelok's stash. Go to the door as before and after the white flash, you're in the room with Luke's body. Take his PDA, Last record in the Luke's brocken PDA. Now you can follow the same path as before, taking all the time you want to collect stashes and check wooden boxes (the lockers by the circular stairs are empty). When you get to the bottom of the circular stairs, turn right this time to teleport to the Cordon. 
<div>Note: I've seen a video that shows a stash in the backpack of the corpse near the bottom of the stairs containing a third PDA, the PDA Dead in Dungeon (according to Google Translate). I don't know how to obtain this stash, so if you do, please send me a note at kwag_myers@att.net.</div>
You spawn inside a drainage pipe with transition points at either end. If you go forward you transition point to the Freedom Base in Dark Valley. If you turn and go south, you teleport to the Army Warehouses (<a href="#sultan">more information</a>).</p>
<p>We can get to the Agroprom rather quickly now, because the transition point at the north end of the Swamp now works. So, move forward to teleport to Dark Valley. Then up the ladder to the overpass (where you met First Stalker) and teleport to the Bonfire under tree in the Cordon. Head south to the transition point to the Swamp, then north to get back to Agroprom and return the PDA. Then go tell Vivisector about Luke, who keeps Luke's PDA. And now, back to Limansk. On our way we'll clean up the CNPP.</p>
<p>By now, we have a couple of options to get back to Sidorovich's: 
<ul><li>Use the transition point south of the Duty Base to the Swamp, then the northeast transition point to the Cordon.</li>
<li>Use the transition point at the east end of the Road to the Garbage, then the transition point at the Receiving Outpost.</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 id="CNPP2">Chernobyl NPP 2</h3>
<p>When you get to the building where you jumped over the rail, this time use the teleport in the southeast corner of the roof to get to the overpass. Luke's PDA says to clear out Monolith, so here we go. As you advance, Monolith spawn as they did in Shadow of Chernobyl. Once again, they're armed with Barrett .50 cals and SVUmk-2s, so keep your head down. Two spawn at first, then three more as you advance. Once you get to where the overpass forks, when you go to the right there's a cut scene fly over of that section. There are two Monolith that spawn in front of the crate barricade and two more on the other side. And you may take some fire from a guy on the overpass with pipes on either side which runs north and south.<div>Side note: During one play through I made my way down to the ground taking the reverse route of Shadow of Chernobyl, which I'll explain in the next paragraph. I was hoping to talk with Gunslinger, but he was still in statue mode. However, I noticed the mission objective arrow on my minimap pointing to the north end of this overpass. When I got there, a dialog told me the teleport was disabled.</div></p>
<p>Once you're done with Monolith, there's a Burer and zombies to the east. Looking at the PDA map, there are six circular towers near the center of the complex with two helicopters to the west. The building directly south of the helicopters is where we spawned after the first teleport out of the tunnel and had to fight through three waves of Russian Special Forces. To the west of that building are two smaller buildings. The Burer and zombies are on the west side of these builings. You can either jump over the side and take some damage, or make your way to the ground this way:
<ol><li>Up the ladder at the end of the overpass.</li>
<li>Southwest to the ladder up.</li>
<li>West over the pipes.</li>
<li>Down the ladder at the northwest corner of the roof.</li>
<li>Northwest and down the ladder at the northwest corner of that roof.</li>
<li>Go west along the wall that is north of you position.</li>
<li>Go northeast toward the Clear Sky guys running around. The Burer and zombies are east of Clear Sky's position.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>There is also three Special Forces patroling near the two helicopters. From there, go northwest to where (referring to the PDA map) the overpass with pipes running north and south meets with the overpass that runs at a northeast to southwest angle. You can use the rubble as a ramp to get back up onto the overpass. Go through all the teleports again until you get to the overpass that forks where you can jump over the rail to teleport to Limansk.</p>
<h3 id="limansk2">Limansk 2</h3>
<p>From the deli, follow the road north until the anomaly that seems to block the road. There's an iron gate to the right with a few bars missing so you can get through. Then turn left and continue north. When you get to the car, turn northeast and go up the long flight of stairs. Make your way through the house and out the north side where you'll see a bridge over a canal and the House on hill on the other side.</p>
<p id="fdlimansk">The House on hill is occupied by Monolith. You can easily bypass this fortification by turning to the left when you get to the bridge and walking through the fence and then crossing the canal. However, one of them has a flash drive that you may want, the Flash drive with data on upgrade weapons (blue). If you approach the house from the west, you should be able to pick them off one by one, starting one in the doorway and the other in the window. Then move up to the house and shoot through the windows, working your way around the back of the house, then inside. Being able to walk through fences has its advantages.</p>
<p>Once you're done making and checking corpses, exit on the west side of the house, through the fence and between the buildings where you'll find the Space Bubble anomaly maze. On the other side is at least one Burer (three total) and a handful of zombies at the bottom of the hill. You can go through the maze without having to avoid the anomalies because they don't work. For some reason you can't get into the bus, but you can jump on top of it. Most of the zombies coming down the stairs to the north can be taken out with an RPG. There's one without a weapon that takes a shot gun to the head before he goes down. As you approach the construction site, Lotsman sends a message about the doctor on the top floor.</p>
<p id="scarPDA">There are three Burers total in this area, but only a few Monolith. One scientist shows up as friendly and gives you the location of Scar's PDA when you ask him for a job, so don't kill him. But the guy at the top, according to Lotsman, needs to go down. If you try to approach him you get teleported to a very great height and splat somewhere in the woods. See <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Construction_Site#Walkthrough" target="_blank">my walkthrough</a> if you need help clearing out the construction site.</p>
<h3 id="galetskiy">Galetskiy</h3>
<p>With the mad scientist down and the coordinates for Scar's PDA from Dr. O'Zone, head back to the deli to escort Galetskiy back to his daughter. Take him to the tunnel where you both teleport back to the Red Forest. Only, Galetskiy spawns at the other end of the tunnel, i.e., the west side of the bridge. You, on the other hand, spawn on top of the tank and are surrounded by zombies. Sprint south to the Devilish Encampment, through the Mutant's Den and west to the bridge. Cross the bridge and find Galetskiy in his usual position, cowering in the corner. Talk to him to get him to stand up, then let him go over the bridge first. For some reason, the Clear Sky guys shoot at him, but eventually he moves into the woods where he stops constantly to check his imaginary detector. Between stops, Galetskiy advances to the mine. He goes to the back, then stands like a statue (waiting for his daughter). So, back to the Cordon to get Anelia. The guide at the Camp Near Caper should be able to take you back to the Village Center.</p>
<p>Find Anelia, who is hold up in the underground storm cellar, and offer to take her to her father. She leads the way, leaving the camp on the west end, over the hill to the Bonfire Under Tree, through the fence (I guess she can do the fence thing too) and up the hill toward the hidden transition point, then turns around and goes back past the east entrance to the Village Center. What is it with this family? Anyway, she goes through the tunnel under the railroad tracks, past the Encampment in Trough and stops just before the two transition points. If you haven't taken care of the two mutants here, you may want to sprint ahead and do that before she gets there. When Anelia stops, she tells you to meet her in the Agroprom, then turns and disappears.</p>
<div>Note: As before, if you get too far away from Anelia, she returns to the starting point and you have to start all over again. Also, I noticed that when I tried to quick save and go back to that point, she might return to the starting point. Regular saves seem to be safe, but still, be sure to save at the beginning of each map.</div>
<p>Go back to the Encampment in the Trough and continue to the transition point to the Swamp. Avoid the Northern Farmstead Bandits and go north to the railroad tracks. Follow them west until you reach the corpse, grab the PDA, and head northeast to the transition point to Agroprom. When you spawn in the Agroprom, go left of the anomaly find Anelia sitting by the fence. When you stand next to her for a few seconds she stands up and goes north, then another Galetskiy family detour up the enbankment and eventually east toward the Fork in the Road. From here, Anelia goes north to the enbankment that runs east and west on the north side of the railroad tracks. Sprint ahead to clear out any mutants, because if she dies, you die.</p>
<p>Once she gets almost to the Camp Under Tower, she turns north and goes straight to the fence, then turns left (west) and goes to the transition point to Yantar. When you get near the transition point, which is marked with an opening in the fence, stop and let Anelia go until she disappears. If you teleport too soon, she sits down right where she is and you have to go back to where you started this map.</p>
<p>When you spawn in Yantar and Anelia is behind you, go east or west far enough to get around the transition point and stand next to her to get her moving. Since this next part is a bit challenging, I tried leaving her there while I cleared the way, but the zombies respawned even before I could get back to Anelia. When you meet up with Anelia and follow her to the transition point, click No and she continues toward the Scientist's Camp, then turns east. You just have to follow her as she zigzags through the southeastern part of the map. And don't be surprised if she walks through the Springboard anomaly near the Secret Entrance. When she starts up the ramp of the Secret Entrance, go on ahead to the east and clear the way of zombies near the Garages near Parimeter and Power Transformer Booth. Most of the zombies can be taken out with an RPG round, but the Undefeatable Zombies need a head shot from the .50 cal. Through the Factory Entrance and straight to the transition point to the Red Forest.</p>
<p id="blood">You both spawn in the southeast corner of the map. Fortunately, Anelia stays to the outer edge of the forest where it's easy to protect her. However, she does go through a few radiation hot spots, so watch your meters. Once she get near the mine where Galetskiy is, she does the same as he did and stops every ten feet or so. When she gets close enough to him, you can talk to her and she give you the coordinates to the Black artifact of Blood. And then she vanishes. The location of the stash is the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Crate_with_backpack" target="_blank">Crate with backpack</a> of the original Clear Sky. Don't be surprised if some spiders come to greet you when you go get it. In the stash is also Anelia's PDA, which tells you about Zarka in Zaton, who you are now tasked to find.</p>
<h3 id="limansk3">Limansk 3</h3>
<p id="bonus">But first, let's return Scar's PDA to complete the task. Before crossing the bridge, you may want to stop by and have Forester fix up your gear. Then, go to the west end of the bridge and into the tunnel. When you pass the second truck on the left, turn left and continue through the doorways until you are teleported to CNPP. Make your way to the Limansk teleport, and then to the construction site to return Scar's PDA. When you do, you get the Bonus PDA, which instructs you to take a screenshot of it, then head back to the deli.</p>
<h3 id="lotsman">Meet Lotsman</h3>
<p>Lotsman's instructions are as follows: 
<ol>
<li>Jump on the pick-up at the other side of the street...</li>
<li>Then to the fence...</li>
<li>From the fence to the porch roof...</li>
<li>From that roof to the other building roof...</li>
<li>Jump to the tree...</li>
<li>To the balcony</li>
</ol></p>
<p id="construction">The pick-up directly across the street (west) from the deli is near a brick wall. Climb up the front bumper, hood, and roof, then jump to the wall and walk to the northeastern corner post. If you want an easy artifact, jump down on the west side of the wall and walk south with your detector to find a Firefly on the ground. Look up and you'll see a Night Star on the balcony (which we can get once we're on the roof). Circle the building to the south and get back to the truck. Once you are back to the norhteastern corner post, align yourself diagonally with the porch roof of the building to the north of the truck, but stay slightly to the right so you don't hit the tree when you jump. You need to be able to step once and then jump to make it to the roof. If you make it, you may want to quick save before moving on. Next, stand on the peak of the roof and jump to the main roof of the building. Go to the west end of the roof and sprint-jump to the roof southwest of you. Go to the other end of that roof and sprint-jump to the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Gastronom" target="_blank">Gastronom</a> building, where you used the teleport in the basement to go back to Dark Valley and collected the fourth flash drive. Now you can get that Night Star.</p>
<p>Move east along the wall to pick up some supplies, then continue around to the porch roof on the east side of the southern part of the building. If you still have your detector out, you can see a glow in the last window. Jump up on the window ledge and crouch to get the Goldfish artifact. Then go back to the north part of the building, where there's three chimneys. If you walk on the south side of the northern chimney, there's a tree branch that you can walk on directly from the roof. Take that to where it joins a larger branch, then turn to the right and down to the next crotch where there's a branch from the tree to the east. Continue east through the second tree, jump to the third tree and continue east to a branch near the southwest corner of the deli's roof. Sprint-jump to the roof, walk slowly off the roof at an angle (otherwise you might overshoot) to the balcony and through the door to meet Lotsman. He tells you of a teleport on the roof of the construction site and agrees to follow you there.</p>
<p>After your conversation with Lotsman, he turns and walks through the wall, leaving you to find your own way out. I jumped off the balcony and discovered Lotsman waiting just to the north of where I landed. Lead him to the House on the Hill, then follow him to the top of the construction site. He tells you the teleport is on the cement slab hanging from the crane, which is on the west side of the building. Getting to the slab before the hanging slab is tricky because you can easily hit your head and not make the jump. The teleport takes you to the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Jupiter_Underground" target="_blank">Jupiter Underground</a> from Call of Pripyat.</p>
<h3 id="jup">Jupiter Underground</h3>
<p>There's a group of zombies on the other side of the truck where you first spawn, plus a Pyrogeist roaming around. Follow the passage south carefully, using the vehicles as cover from the zombies along the way. When you come to where the passage branches to the right and dead-ends, another Pyrogeist starts at you, with a Psuedogiant right behind. There are two trucks back-to-back across the passage where you can jump up on top to deal with the Pyrogeist (I prefer the minigun, but a shot gun works, too). The Psuedogiant should be somewhere near the trucks so you can deploy another Gravi artifact to take it out. Just be sure you don't take yourself out, too.</p>
<p>Stay on the left side walkway and jump up on the shipping container. There's a fence with three corpses and a few more further south. Only, they are really sleeping zombies that wake up as soon as you walk by them. Shooting them is a waste of ammo. Toss a grenade or two near the doorway on the left. This usually gets the invisible spiders going and you can use the shot gun on them. Also, by now you are probably in a Controller's Aura by now. When the way is clear, jump down the south side of the container, jump up on the next container and get your .50 cal ready for the Controller to come through the door. You may get a couple more spiders, too. Again, when the way is clear, jump down and sprint through the door and down two flights of stairs. There is usually one armed zombie along the way here, so be ready for it.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, turn right and switch to the flamethrower as you sprint. Through the next door and turn right to follow the tracks on the right until the box car blocks the way, then move over to the left and continue sprinting. One option (if you're running low on flamethrower fuel) is to jump up on the locomotive and climb to the top where you can use a shot gun or minigun on the Psuedodogs, Snorks, and maybe even cap the Burer if it comes in from the next room. Whether you stop or not, follow the tracks into the next room until you pass two tanker cars on the right where there's a doorway just beyond. Once inside the doorway you are out of range for the Burer and Controller, but you probably have a few Psuedodogs on your trail. Cook them with the flamethrower and get ready for another group coming from the other way. Before you go through that door you should know that there's another Controller, probably at the top of the stairs. Duck inside the door and to the left to switch to the .50 cal. The Controller may even walk down the stairs, making it an easy head shot. This might be a good place to switch back to the flamethrower and Save.</p>
<p id="update">Up the stairs and into a flooded hallway with those giant rodents we first encountered in the Agroprom Underground. Stay in the open area at the top of the stairs and let the rodents come to you. At the end of the next hall go left and through the doorway straight ahead into a room with a crate containing Gravi Gun ammo and Save again. Out the door and around to the right are more spiders and two invisible bloodsuckers (one of them is carrying a Night Star artifact). The only way to see the bloodsuckers is to stand in water so you can see their footsteps. Northeast of the room you're in is a good spot where you can stand in front of the gate and throw a grenade to attract their attention. The only weapon that I've found to work on them is the shot gun. My strategy for the spiders is to lure them to the room with grenades where I cook them as they came through the door. You can also use a minigun (which tends to jam at this point) or RPG and keep retreating toward the large circular room until you get them all. At the end of the passage is a door on the left with an armed zombie waiting. If the zombie hasn't come out while you were dealing with the others, throw a grenade into the door to clear the way, then check to be sure you got him. He's only got a shot gun so he's not very dangerous.</p>
<p id="zarkaPDA">The way is mostly clear now and you can either go back to explore the area that you sprinted through or continue on and explore the room during your next visit. In the large circular room, there's a squad of Patrol Time who carry a semi-automatic Gauss and any mutants, Burer, Controller, etc. that you didn't deal with before. Also, there's an Exoskeleton in a crate that's located in a room south of the entrance to the overhead control room, which is on the west side of the circular room. This next part you may want to save for the next time through because the jump is a tricky one. Go to the platform with the generator on top (where you had to power up the generator to open the door in Call of Pripyat). Climb on top of the generator and either next to, or on top of the tank on the south end. Sprint-jump to the ledge west of the generator and go halfway up the ramp. Turn to the right and jump to the cat walk that leads to the Control Room. Inside the Control Room on the control panel is Zarka's PDA. When you're done exploring, return to the end of the passage and up the ladder to spawn back in Limansk.</p>
<h3 id="monolith">Monolith</h3>
<p>You're in the sewer pipe southeast of the House on the Hill. Make your way to back to the construction site once again. You may have noticed a sniper taking shots at you as you were moving about the construction site before. There's more Monolith waiting in the building to the northeast, the courtyard in front of the <a href="http://stalker.wikia.com/wiki/Radiowave_Institute" target="_blank">Radiowave Institure</a>, and in the tower. You can take most of them out from the construction site with a Dragunov or Guass. There's also some mutants and a little surprise inside the build to the northeast. I had to use a Gravi artifact placed in the dug out area where you go under the northern gate of the construction site to get rid of the Psuedogiant. Once the artifact was in place, I went back under the gate and had to lure the beast in by shooting at it. Once the Psuedogiant was out of the way, I was able to jump on top of the shipping containers to the west and over the wall.</p>
<p id="PDAPriplusovannys">Approach the building to the northeast where all the Monolith came from carefully. If any Monolith come out, waste them. Once inside, you'll find some guys that cannot be killed, but they don't attack either. There's one in an Exoskeleton suit named Giga Programmer. Tell him you want to join Monolith and he gives you a flash drive with instructions on how to get Priplusovanny's PDA. Nice little plot twist, eh? Now you have to go back and clear out the Clear Sky camp. There's two other guys in the next room, a trader that only sells and a technician.</p>
<div>If you follow the same path to the north as you did in the original game, the transition point takes you to the barracks of the Military outpost in the south of the Cordon, and they are not happy to see you.</div>
<p>Giga Programmer also mentions the teleport in the basement (dungeon) of the Gastronom building. We'll use that to get to the Dark Valley, Cordon, and then to the Swamp. The shortest way from the building you met Giga Programmer in, is to go through the fence on the east side of the construction site, south through the arch way in the building, and pass on the east side of the House on the Hill. Once you get to the Gastronom building, go to the basement and teleport to the Dark Valley overpass. In the overpass, move ahead (north) to teleport out to the Camp at Bottom of Ravine. Then head south to teleport to the Cordon. Remember, everyone is an enemy, so avoid contact. From the tunnel of the Cordon, head to the Bonfire under Tree and then to the teleport to the Swamp. Once you're back in the Swamp, move along the edge of the map staying south of the Old Church and east of the Fishing Village. As you approach the Clear Sky base, you may notice green dots on your minimap. These are the mutants that Bashnya has tamed. Once you finish with the base, you get a message telling you to return to the Jupiter Underground.</p>

<p><i>From here on are random notes from previous playthroughs as I'm still working on what to do from this point on.</i></p>
<p>So far, we've met the following objectives:
<ul><li>Found the Art-hunter and bought artifacts.</li>
<li>Found the way to Limansk.</li>
<li>Found two of three Artifacts Of Death.</li>
<li>Collected 11 of 12 PDAs (I think). This is a little confusing because I've been told there are actually 24 PDAs and we actually have collected 20. Here are the PDAs mentioned on <a href="#glykin">Commandant Glykin's PDA</a>, <a href="#valley">PDA los in Valley</a>, and <a href="#forgotten">PDA from Garbage</a> along with the other PDAs we've found:
<h4>3 in the Dark Valley</h4>
<ol>
<li><a href="#dvPDAs">Uncle Artikular friend's PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#valley">PDA los in Valley</a></li>
<li><a href="#glykin">Commandant Glykin's PDA</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>2 in the Red Forest</h4>
<ol start="4">
<li><a href="#521">Fivetwentyone's PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#lost">PDA of Lost in Red Forest</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>3 in the Garbage</h4>
<ol start="6">
<li><a href="#forgotten">Forgotten PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#forgotten">PDA from Garbage</a></li>
<li><a href="#unknown">PDA of the Unknown</a></li>
</ol>

</ol>
<h4>2 in the Military Warehouses</h4>
<ol start="12">
<li><a href="#iscPDA">Intelligent Service Commander&#39;s PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#ocaPDA">O'consciousness Agent PDA</a></li>
</ol>
<h4>1 in the Cordon</h4>
<ol start="14">
<li>Greek's PDA? - I found a video showing a Deserter PDA in the same spot at the original Clear Sky, i.e., the tunnel at the east end of the train tracks. However, judging from the player's inventory in the video, it seems the corpse does not appear until later in the game.</li>
</ol>
<h4>1 in the Swamp</h4>
<ol start="15">
<li><a href="#scarPDA">Scar's PDA</a></li>
</ol>
And then there's the two we found in Agroprom that aren't mentioned: 
<ol start="16">
<li><a href="#sheluden">Sheluden's PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#loghouse">PDA from loghouse on the swamp, Agroprom</a></li>
<li><a href="#returned">PDA of returned from Limansk</a></li>
<li><a href="#blood">Anelia's PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#bonus">Bonus PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#zarkaPDA">Zarka's PDA</a></li>
<li><a href="#lukes">PDA of Dead in Dungeon</a> (which I actually haven't acquired yet, but I know it's there).</li>
</ol>
</ul>
We've also located the four flash drives assigned to us by First Stalker, plus a fifth, which tells us about eight so-called hidden transition points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agroprom 1 - South of Duty base</li>
<li>Cordon 3 - Sidorovich's backroom and two near the drain pipe in the northwest</li>
<li>Garbage 1 - Flea Market</li>
<li>Swamps 1 - Between two graves</li>
<li>Yantar 2 - Island and southeast corner of the factory complex</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus the one at the north end of Dark Valley and in the Cordon north of the Bonfire under Tree.</p>

<!--Once you have the PDA, you need to clear out the zombies on the near side of the bridge (in spite of what Forester told you about staying away from the bridge). You'll be coming back this way and the only way I've found to get through is to take these zombies out now. Here's how I did it, quick-saving at each step:
<ol><li>Take out your favorite sniper rifle, but not one with a silencer, and move toward the bridge staying to the right as much as possible. At some point, the cut scene plays.</li>
<li>After the cut scene, take cover behind the truck cab. There may be two zombies inside the ground floor of the building, one packing an RPG and the other an RP-74. These two you can take out with a head shot from an SVDn-2, but they don't show themselves until you make some noise. So, take a shot at one of the other zombies (the SVDn-2 doesn't seem to bother the other zombies) and then take aim at the door.</li>
<li>Once those two are down, or if no one comes out, switch to the shot gun or mini-gun and sprint past the other zombies until you get inside the tunnel. Note that you can't sprint with the mini-gun out, so you need to put it away.</li>
<li>By now, the pseudo-flight of the Controller has probably started. Between each "flight", run out and head shot a zombie or two, then back to the safety of the tunnel. Keep an eye on the bridge and if you see any spiders, head to the back of the tunnel where the ground starts to slop down and switch back to the mini-gun. Shoot the barrels near the entrance once you are sure the spiders are inside the tunnel. Then take out any spiders that survive the blast.</li>
<li>While you're doing this, the Controller is making its way over the bridge, so keep an eye on your HUD for a red dot. Once the zombies are down, use the building as cover and take out the Controller. There may also be a Burer on the other side of the bridge, and a Poltergeist traveling back and forth over the bridge, too.</li>
</ol></p>-->











<h3>Cordon notes</h3>


<div id="sultan">The Flash drive with data of hidden transition point on the Cordon mentions transition points that seem to be marked already. We've already been to Sidorovich's back room, and the two other transition points are marked (northwest of the Old farmstead). I had one fellow stalker tell me that Sidorovich's transition point took him to Limansk instead of the CNPP. As for the other two, the one facing north takes you inside the drain pipe southwest of the Vehicle Graveyard, which is in a psi field and may have a Burer near the opening. The transition point facing west takes you to the Army Warehouses. However, I've found that once I've been to that map, the game crashes on me every time I try to use it again. If it works for you, here's what happens:
<p>There are a couple mutants nearby, but if you stay up on the hill that runs east of the transition points, they won&#39;t bother you. Once you get alined with the large drain pipe to the west, walk right in front of it. This takes you to the roof of the main building in the Army Warehouses complex.</p>
<p>There&#39;s some goodies inside, but you&#39;ll have to deal with some zombies. If you just walk off the roof, you&#39;ll need some bandages and/or vodka to stop the bleeding. Ahead and to the left of where you spawn there is a hole in the edge of the roof where you can drop down to the window ledge, and then to the ground without taking any damage.</p>
<p>Sprint to the kitchen where you&#39;ll meet up with Sultan. Yeah, he&#39;s also a long way from the Skadovsk and he shows on your map as an enemy, but you can't kill him. Instead, talk to him and agree to help him to the Garbage. Before leaving the kitchen, there&#39;s a stash in the room on the right where Sultan is standing. Don&#39;t bother hanging with Sultan, because he walks right into the center of all the mutants. I read one account where Sultan actually makes it out and goes to the Freedom squad to the north, who promptly kill him.</p>
<p>Check the street before you leave the kitchen and go around the north side of the building. There&#39;s three or four zombies standing guard, but there&#39;s plenty of cover to snipe from. A couple rounds to the head with a Vintar BC usually takes care of them without alerting the rest. Once you get under the bridge, sprint along the wall on your left until it ends and run up the hill and out the gate.</p>
</div>





<!-- with a couple squads of Clear Sky fighting on the other side (which includes some interesting characters). Eventually, they cross the bridge. Use this time to collect ammo, just keep an eye out for the Poltergeist that crosses the bridge, goes into the forest and then comes back. If you kill it, another one spawns and resumes the cycle, so don't waste your ammo. Also, there's a Burer on the other side that can get you with its bad breath.</p>
<p>Once the Clear Sky group clear the bridge, you can cross (talking to them doesn't get you any useful information). If you stop to pick up any ammo on the far side of the bridge, keep watch for mutants. Go straight to the back of the tunnel where the transition point is and spawn, once again, inside the elevated overpass in the Dark Valley. Only this time you're at a different spot further north.</p>
<p>Take out your knife and smash open the crate by your feet. There's at least one flash drive with some information about a transition point south of the Duty base in the Agroprom. But don't stop to read it just yet because it's a radiation hot zone. Turn around and walk south into the next transition point.</p>
<p>You spawn back at the Garbage, but usually in a safe place so you can read the flash drive. The URL on the flash drive (<a href="http://www.reborn-stalker.ws/er/reborn_secret_agro_coordinates.rar">http://www.reborn-stalker.ws/er/reborn_secret_agro_coordinates.rar</a>) results in a 404 - Page Not Found error. The message, I assume, is referring to the Southern Duty Base in the Agroprom.</p>
<p>This is as far as I've gotten:
<ul><li>I tried going back to the Red Forest (via the Guide at the Flea Market) and using the transition point on the other side of the bridge again, but the spawn point is the same.</li>
<li>I tried talking to the Guide at the Flea Market, but none of the destinations looked promising.</li>
<li>I tried the Flea Market transition point mentioned on the PDA of returned from Limansk, but ended up in the Swamp. The transition point to Agroprom, north of the train cars, still doesn't work.</li></ul></p>

<!--Gunslinger at CNPP
<p>My strategy for saving Gunslinger is to move behind the structure to the right and clear any Monolith between me and Gunslinger as quickly as possible. Then, move to the left and along the north rail up to the structure on the northeast corner of the roof, using the other structures as cover. Any snipers that you didn't take care of before are going to be shooting at you now. Once the roof is clear, you should be able to finish them off. But don't get too close to Gunslinger just yet. When you do, another wave of Monolith spawn. I used the Bulldog 6 on the two guys that spawn on either side of Gunslinger. Then switched back to the .50 cal for the rest. Gunslinger is pretty much a statue at this point and not much help at all. The third wave of Monolith spawn when you approach the transition point. There's one that spawns behind you if you're facing the transition point. The rest are on the other side of the roof and easy to take care of. Just keep them from shooting Gunslinger.</p>-->

<p>If you want to spend some time at the power plant:</p>
<div>If you go through the transition point you end up on the walkway at the bottom of the ladder where Gunslinger is standing. Moving forward, the walkway forks: 
<ul><li>To the right doesn't seem to get you anywhere. You can jump on top of the obsticles to get over them and up a ladder. If there happens to be a sniper on the other side of this roof, there's plenty of cover to wait for a Pyrogeist to take care of him. The transition point in the southeast corner sends you plummeting to you death. You can jump up on the structure with three ribs on each side near the stairs where all those snipers were, then sprint jump to the ledge, and jump again over the rail to collect rifles and ammo. You can also take the reverse path of Shadow of Chernobyl and collect some ammo from some of those snipers you killed earlier. You can even make your way to the west and down to the ground to loot some more bodies, which are east of the Clear Sky squad. Just keep an eye out for a few lingering Special Forces.</li>
<li>To the left there is another transition point over the rail which lands you in a caved in tunnel at the south end of Limansk. As you make your way over the rubble you are transported to the tank in the Red Forest where zombies and mutant spiders promply end your reality. If, however, you say No to the transition point (and you may need to say No more than once) you can make your way over the rubble and into <a href="#limansk">Limansk</a>. Jumping over the obstruction and through the transition point puts you back on the roof with Gunslinger. Go up to the eastern edge of the roof and you'll see a Clear Sky squad fighting with two Burers and some zombies. If you go through the transition point by Gunslinger again, some Monolith spawn in the same places as Shadow of Chernobyl.</li></ul></div>
